<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> had three objects before me in writing this book.
The first concerns the general reader. 'No one needs assistance
in order to perceive Shakespeare's greatness; but an
impression is not uncommonly to be found, especially
amongst English readers, that Shakespeare's greatness lies
mainly in his deep knowledge of human nature, while, as to
the technicalities of Dramatic Art, he is at once careless of
them and too great to need them. I have endeavoured to
combat this impression by a series of Studies of Shakespeare
as a Dramatic Artist. They are chiefly occupied with a
few master-strokes of art, sufficient to illustrate the revolution
Shakespeare created in the Drama of the world&mdash;a revolution
not at once perceived simply because it had carried the
Drama at a bound so far beyond Dramatic Criticism that the
appreciation of Shakespeare's plays was left to the uninstructed
public, while the trained criticism that ought to have
recognised the new departure was engaged in clamouring for
other views of dramatic treatment, which it failed to perceive
that Shakespeare had rendered obsolete.</p>

<p>While the earlier chapters are taken up with these Studies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>the rest of the work is an attempt, in very brief form, to present
Dramatic Criticism as a regular Inductive Science. If
I speak of this as a new branch of Science I am not ignoring
the great works on Shakespeare-Criticism which already
exist, the later of which have treated their subject in an
inductive spirit. What these still leave wanting is a <em>recognition</em>
of method in application to the study of the Drama: my
purpose is to claim for Criticism a position amongst the
Inductive Sciences, and to sketch in outline a plan for the
Dramatic side of such a Critical Science.</p>

<p>A third purpose has been to make the work of use as an
educational manual. Shakespeare now enters into every
scheme of liberal education; but the annotated editions of
his works give the student little assistance except in the explanation
of language and allusions; and the idea, I believe,
prevails that anything like the discussion of literary characteristics
or dramatic effect is out of place in an educational
work&mdash;is, indeed, too 'indefinite' to be 'examined on.' Ten
years' experience in connection with the Cambridge University
Extension, during which my work has been to teach
literature apart from philology, has confirmed my impression
that the subject-matter of literature, its exposition and
analysis from the sides of science, history, and art, is as good
an educational discipline as it is intrinsically valuable in
quickening literary appreciation.</p>

<p>There are two special features of the book to which I may
here draw attention. Where practicable, I have appended in
the margin references to the passages of Shakespeare on which
my discussion is based. (These references are to the Globe
Edition.) I have thus hoped to reduce to a minimum the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>element of personal opinion, and to give to my treatment at
least that degree of definiteness which arises when a position
stands side by side with the evidence supporting it. I have
also endeavoured to meet a practical difficulty in the use of
Shakespeare-Criticism as an educational subject. It is usual
in educational schemes to name single plays of Shakespeare
for study. Experience has convinced me that methodical
study of the subject-matter is not possible within the compass
of a single play. On the other hand, few persons in the
educational stage of life can have the detailed knowledge of
Shakespeare's plays as a whole which is required for a full
treatment of the subject. The present work is so arranged
that it assumes knowledge of only five plays&mdash;<em>The Merchant
of Venice</em>, <em>Richard III</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, and <em>King Lear</em>.
Not only in the Studies, but also in the final review, the
matter introduced is confined to what can be illustrated out
of these five plays. These are amongst the most familiar of
the Shakespearean Dramas, or they can be easily read before
commencing the book; and if the arrangement is a limitation
involving a certain amount of repetition, yet I believe the
gain will be greater than the loss. For the young student, at
all events, it affords an opportunity of getting what will be
the best of all introductions to the whole subject&mdash;a thorough
knowledge of five plays.</p>

<p>In passing the book through the press I have received
material assistance from my brother, Dr. Moulton, Master of
the Leys School, and from my College friend, Mr. Joseph
Jacobs. With the latter, indeed, I have discussed the work
in all its stages, and have been under continual obligation to
his stores of knowledge and critical grasp in all departments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>of literary study. I cannot even attempt to name the many
friends&mdash;chiefly fellow-workers in the University Extension
Movement&mdash;through whose active interest in my Shakespeare
teaching I have been encouraged to seek for it
publication.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Proposition.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">IN the treatment of literature the proposition which seems to stand most
in need of assertion at the present moment is, <em>that there is an
inductive science of literary criticism</em>. As botany deals inductively
with the phenomena of vegetable life and traces the laws underlying
them, as economy reviews and systematises on inductive principles the
facts of commerce, so there is a criticism not less inductive in
character which has for its subject-matter literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Presumption
in
favour of
inductive
literary
criticism.</em></div>

<p>The presumption is clearly that literary criticism should follow other
branches of thought in becoming inductive. Ultimately, science means no
more than organised thought; and amongst the methods of organisation
induction is the most practical. To begin with the observation of facts;
to advance from this through the arrangement of observed facts; to use <em>à
priori</em> ideas, instinctive notions of the fitness of things, insight into
far probabilities, only as side-lights for suggesting convenient
arrangements, the value of which is tested only by the actual
convenience in arranging they afford; to be content with the sure
results so obtained as 'theory' in the interval of waiting for still
surer results based on a yet wider accumulation of facts: this is a
regimen for healthy science so widely established in different tracts of
thought as almost to rise to that universal acceptance which we call
common sense. Indeed the whole progress of science consists in winning
fresh fields of thought to the inductive methods.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Current
conceptions
of criticism
coloured by
notions
other than
inductive.</em></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Yet the great mass of literary criticism at the present
moment is of a nature widely removed from induction. The
prevailing notions of criticism are dominated by the idea of
<em>assaying</em>, as if its function were to test the soundness and
estimate the comparative value of literary work. Lord
Macaulay, than whom no one has a better right to be heard
on this subject, compares his office of reviewer to that of a
king-at-arms, versed in the laws of literary precedence, marshalling
authors to the exact seats to which they are entitled.
And, as a matter of fact, the bulk of literary criticism,
whether in popular conversation or in discussions by professed
critics, occupies itself with the merits of authors and
works; founding its estimates and arguments on canons of
taste, which are either assumed as having met with general
acceptance, or deduced from speculations as to fundamental
conceptions of literary beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Criticism
judicial
and inductive.
The two distinguished.</em></div>

<p>It becomes necessary then to recognise two different kinds
of literary criticism, as distinct as any two things that can be
called by the same name. The difference between the two
may be summed up as the difference between the work of
a <em>judge</em> and of an <em>investigator</em>. The one is the enquiry into
what ought to be, the other the enquiry into what is.
Judicial criticism compares a new production with those
already existing in order to determine whether it is inferior
to them or surpasses them; criticism of investigation makes
the same comparison for the purpose of identifying the new
product with some type in the past, or differentiating it and
registering a new type. Judicial criticism has a mission to
watch against variations from received canons; criticism of
investigation watches for new forms to increase its stock of
species. The criticism of taste analyses literary works for
grounds of preference or evidence on which to found judgments;
inductive criticism analyses them to get a closer
acquaintance with their phenomena.</p>

<p>Let the question be of Ben Jonson. Judicial criticism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>starts by
holding Ben Jonson responsible for the decay of the English Drama.</p>

<p>Inductive criticism takes objection to the word 'decay' as
suggesting condemnation, but recognises Ben Jonson as the
beginner of a new tendency in our dramatic history.</p>

<p>But, judicial criticism insists, the object of the Drama is
to pourtray human nature, whereas Ben Jonson has painted
not men but caricatures.</p>

<p>Induction sees that this formula cannot be a sufficient
definition of the Drama, for the simple reason that it does
not take in Ben Jonson; its own mode of putting the matter
is that Ben Jonson has founded a school of treatment of
which the law is caricature.</p>

<p>But Ben Jonson's caricatures are palpably impossible.</p>

<p>Induction soon satisfies itself that their point lies in their
impossibility; they constitute a new mode of pourtraying
qualities of character, not by resemblance, but by analysing
and intensifying contrasts to make them clearer.</p>

<p>Judicial criticism can see how the poet was led astray; the
bent of his disposition induced him to sacrifice dramatic
propriety to his satiric purpose.</p>

<p>Induction has another way of putting the matter: that the
poet has utilised dramatic form for satiric purpose; thus by
the 'cross-fertilisation' of two existing literary species he has
added to literature a third including features of both.</p>

<p>At all events, judicial criticism will maintain, it must be
admitted that the Shakespearean mode of pourtraying is
infinitely the higher: a sign-painter, as Macaulay points out,
can imitate a deformity of feature, while it takes a great
artist to bring out delicate shades of expression.</p>

<p>Inductive treatment knows nothing about higher or lower,
which lie outside the domain of science. Its point is that
science is indebted to Ben Jonson for a new species; if the
new species be an easier form of art it does not on that
account lose its claim to be analysed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>

The critic of merit can always fall back upon taste: who
would not prefer Shakespeare to Ben Jonson?</p>

<p>But even from this point of view scientific treatment can
plead its own advantages. The inductive critic reaps to the
full the interest of Ben Jonson, to which the other has been
forcibly closing his eyes; while, so far from liking Shakespeare
the less, he appreciates all the more keenly Shakespeare's
method of treatment from his familiarity with that
which is its antithesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The two
criticisms
confused:</em></div>

<p>It must be conceded at once that both these kinds of
criticism have justified their existence. Judicial criticism has
long been established as a favourite pursuit of highly cultivated
minds; while the criticism of induction can shelter
itself under the authority of science in general, seeing that it
has for its object to bring the treatment of literature into the
circle of the inductive sciences. <span class="sidenote"><em>conception
of critical
method
limited to
judicial
method.</em></span>It is unfortunate, however,
that the spheres of the two have not been kept distinct. In
the actual practice of criticism the judicial method has obtained
an illegitimate supremacy which has thrown the other into the
shade; it has even invaded the domain of the criticism that
claims to be scientific, until the word <em>criticism</em> itself has suffered,
and the methodical treatment of literature has by tacit
assumption become limited in idea to the judicial method.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Partly a
survival of
Renaissance
influence:</em></div>

<p>Explanation for this limited conception of criticism is not
far to seek. Modern criticism took its rise before the
importance of induction was recognised: it lags behind
other branches of thought in adapting itself to inductive
treatment chiefly through two influences. The first of these
is connected with the revival of literature after the darkness
of the middle ages. The birth of thought and taste in
modern Europe was the Renaissance of classical thought
and taste; by Roman and Greek philosophy and poetry the
native powers of our ancestors were trained till they became
strong enough to originate for themselves. It was natural
for their earliest criticism to take the form of applying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
classical standards to their own imitations:
<span class="sidenote"><em>and its
testing by
classical
models.</em></span>now we have
advanced so far that no one would propose to test exclusively
by classical models, but nevertheless the idea of
<em>testing</em> still lingers as the root idea in the treatment of literature.
Other branches of thought have completely shaken off
this attitude of submission to the past: literary criticism
differs from the rest only in being later to move. This is
powerfully suggested by the fact that so recent a writer
as Addison couples science in general with criticism in
his estimate of probable progress; laying down the startling
proposition that 'it is impossible for us who live in the later
ages of the world to make observations in criticism, in
morality, <em>or in any art or science</em>, which have not been
touched upon by others'!</p>

have invaded
systematic
criticism.</em></div>

<p>And even for this lateness a second influence goes far to
account. The grand literary phenomenon of modern times is
journalism, the huge apparatus of floating literature of which
leading object is to review literature itself. The vast increase
of production consequent upon the progress of printing
has made production itself a phenomenon worthy of study, and
elevated the sifting of production into a prominent literary
occupation; by the aid of book-tasters alone can the
ordinary reader keep pace with production. It is natural
enough that the influence of journalism should pass beyond
its natural sphere, and that the review should tend to usurp
the position of the literature for which reviewing exists. Now
in journalism testing and valuation of literary work have a
real and important place. It has thus come about that in
the great preponderance of ephemeral over permanent
literature the machinery adapted to the former has become
applied to the latter: methods proper to journalism have
settled the popular conception of systematic treatment; and
the bias already given to criticism by the Renaissance has
been strengthened to resist the tendency of all kinds of
thought towards inductive methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><em>The limitation
defended:
theory of
taste as condensed
experience.</em></div>

<p>History will thus account for the way in which the criticism
of taste and valuation tends to be identified with criticism in
general: but attempts are not wanting to give the identification
a scientific basis. Literary appreciation, it is said, is a
thing of culture. A critic in the reviewer's sense is one who
has the literary faculty both originally acute and developed
by practice: he thus arrives quickly and with certainty at
results which others would reach laboriously and after temporary
misjudgments. Taste, however arbitrary in appearance,
is in reality condensed experience; judicial criticism is
a wise economy of appreciation, the purpose of which is to
anticipate natural selection and universal experience. He is
a good critic who, by his keen and practised judgment, can
tell you at once the view of authors and works which you
would yourself come to hold with sufficient study and
experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The theory
examined.
The judicial
spirit a
limit on appreciation.</em></div>

<p>Now in the first place there is a flaw in this reasoning: it
omits to take into account that the judicial attitude of mind
is itself a barrier to appreciation, as being opposed to that
delicacy of receptiveness which is a first condition of sensibility
to impressions of literature and art. It is a matter
of commonest experience that appreciation may be interfered
with by prejudice, by a passing unfavourable mood, or
even by uncomfortable external surroundings. But it is by
no means sufficient that the reader of literature should divest
himself of these passive hindrances to appreciation: poets
are pioneers in beauty, and considerable activity of effort
is required to keep pace with them. Repetition may be
necessary to catch effects&mdash;passages to be read over and
over again, more than one author of the same school to
be studied, effect to be compared with kindred effect each
helping the other. Or an explanation from one who has
already caught the idea may turn the mind into a receptive
attitude. Training again is universally recognised as a necessity
for appreciation, and to train is to make receptive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<span class="sidenote"><em>On the other hand sympathy the great interpreter.</em></span>Beyond
all these conditions of perception, and including
them, is yet another. It is a foundation principle in art-culture,
as well as in human intercourse, that <em>sympathy is the
grand interpreter</em>: secrets of beauty will unfold themselves to
the sunshine of sympathy, while they will wrap themselves
all the closer against the tempest of sceptical questionings.
Now a judicial attitude of mind is highly unreceptive, for it
necessarily implies a restraint of sympathy: every one,
remarks Hogarth, is a judge of painting except the connoisseur.
The judicial mind has an appearance of receptiveness,
because it seeks to shut out prejudice: but what if the
idea of judging be itself a prejudice? On this view the very
consciousness of fairness, involving as it does limitation of
sympathy, will be itself unfair. In practical life, where
we have to act, the formation of judgments is a necessity.
In art we can escape the obligation, and here the judicial
spirit becomes a wanton addition to difficulties of appreciation
already sufficiently great; the mere notion of condemning
may be enough to check our receptivity to qualities
which, as we have seen, it may need our utmost effort to
catch. So that the judicial attitude of mind comes to defeat
its own purpose, and disturbs unconsciously the impression
it seeks to judge; until, as Emerson puts it, 'if you criticise
a fine genius the odds are that you are out of your reckoning,
and instead of the poet are censuring your caricature
of him.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The theory
refuted by
experience:
the history
of criticism
a triumph
of authors
over critics.</em></div>

<p>But the appeal made is to experience: to experience let
it go. It will be found that, speaking broadly, <em>the whole
history of criticism has been a triumph of authors over critics</em>:
so long as criticism has meant the gauging of literature, so
long its progress has consisted in the reversal of critical
judgments by further experience. I hesitate to enlarge upon
this part of my subject lest I be inflicting upon the reader
the tedium of a thrice-told tale. But I believe that the
ordinary reader, however familiar with notable blunders of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
criticism, has little idea of that which is the essence of my
argument&mdash;the degree of regularity, amounting to absolute
law, with which criticism, where it has set itself in opposition
to freedom of authorship, has been found in time to have
pronounced upon the wrong side, and has, after infinite waste
of obstructive energy, been compelled at last to accept
innovations it had pronounced impossible under penalty of
itself becoming obsolete.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Case of
the Shakespearean
Drama:
retiring
waves of
critical opposition.</em></div>

<p>Shakespeare-criticism affords the most striking illustration.
Its history is made up of wave after wave of critical opposition,
each retiring further before the steady advance of
Shakespeare's fame. They may almost be traced in the
varying apologetic tones of the successive <em>Variorum</em> editors,
until Reed, in the edition of 1803, is content to leave the
poet's renown as established on a basis which will 'bid
defiance to the caprices of fashion and the canker of time.'
<span class="sidenote">I. <em>Unmeasured
attack.</em></span>The first wave was one of unmeasured virulent attack.
Rymer, accepted in his own day as the champion of
'regular' criticism, and pronounced by Pope one of the
best critics England ever had, says that in Tragedy Shakespeare
appears quite out of his element:</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>His brains are turned; he raves and rambles without any coherence,
any spark of reason, or any rule to control him or set bounds to his
phrensy.</p></div>

<p>The shouting and battles of his scenes are necessary to keep
the audience awake, 'otherwise no sermon would be so
strong an opiate.' Again:</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>In the neighing of an horse, or in the growling of a mastiff, there
is a meaning, there is as lively an expression, and, may I say, more
humanity, than many times in the tragical flights of Shakespeare.</p></div>

<p>The famous Suggestion Scene in <em>Othello</em> has, in Rymer's view,
no point but 'the mops, the mows, the grimace, the grins, the
gesticulation.' On Desdemona's</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i7">O good Iago,</div>
<div class="i0">What shall I do to win my lord again?</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>

he remarks that no woman bred out of a pig-stye would talk
so meanly. Speaking of Portia he says, 'she is scarce one
remove from a natural, she is own cousin-german, of one
piece, the very same impertinent flesh and blood with
Desdemona.' And Rymer's general verdict of <em>Othello</em>&mdash;which
he considers the best of Shakespeare's tragedies&mdash;is
thus summed up:</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>There is in this play some burlesque, some humour and ramble of
comical wit, some show and some mimicry to divert the spectators: but
the tragical part is plainly none other than a bloody farce, without salt
or savour.</p></div>

<p>In the eighteenth century Lord Lansdowne, writing on
'Unnatural Flights in Poetry,' could refuse to go into the
question of Shakespeare's soliloquies, as being assured that
'not one in all his works could be excused by reason or
nature.' The same tone was still later kept up by Voltaire,
who calls Shakespeare a writer of monstrous farces called
tragedies; says that nature had blended in him all that is
most great and elevating with all the basest qualities that
belong to barbarousness without genius; and finally proceeds
to call his poetry the fruit of the imagination of an intoxicated
savage.<span class="sidenote">2. <em>The
Shakespearean
Drama
held inadmissible,
yet attractive.</em></span>&mdash;Meanwhile a second wave of opinion had arisen,
not conceiving a doubt as to the total inadmissibility of the
Shakespearean Drama, yet feeling its attraction. This is
perhaps most exactly illustrated in the forgotten critic
Edwards, who ruled that 'poor Shakespeare'&mdash;the expression
his own&mdash;must be excluded from the number of good
tragedians, yet 'as Homer from the Republic of Plato, with
marks of distinction and veneration.' But before this the
more celebrated dramatists of the Restoration had shown the
double feeling in the way they reconstructed Shakespeare's
plays, and turned them into 'correct' dramas. Thus Otway
made the mediæval Capulets and Montagus presentable by
giving them a classical dress as followers of Marius and
Sulla; and even Dryden joined in a polite version of <em>The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>Tempest</em>, with an original touch for symmetry's sake in the
addition to the heroine Miranda, a maid who had never
seen a man, of a suitable hero, a man who had never seen a
maid.<span class="sidenote">3. <em>The
Shakespearean
Drama admitted
with
excuses.</em></span>&mdash;Against loud abuse and patronising reconstruction
the silent power of Shakespeare's works made itself more
and more felt, and we reach a third stage when the Shakespearean
Drama is accepted as it stands, but with excuses.
Excuse is made for the poet's age, in which the English
nation was supposed to be struggling to emerge from barbarism.
Heywood's apology for uniting light and serious
matter is allowed, that 'they who write to all must strive
to please all.' Pope points out that Shakespeare was
dependent for his subsistence on pleasing the taste of
tradesmen and mechanics; and that his 'wrong choice of
subjects' and 'wrong conduct of incidents,' his 'false
thoughts and forced expressions' are the result of his being
forced to please the lowest of the people and keep the worst
of company. Similarly Theobald considers that he schemed
his plots and characters from romances simply for want
of classical information.<span class="sidenote">4. <em>The
Shakespearean
Drama not
felt to need
defence as a
whole, but
praised and
blamed in
its parts.</em></span>&mdash;With the last name we pass to yet
another school, with whom Shakespeare's work as a whole is
not felt to need defence, and the old spirit survives only
in their distribution of praise and blame amongst its different
parts. Theobald opens his preface with the comparison
of the Shakespearean Drama to a splendid pile of buildings,
with 'some parts finished up to hit the taste of a connoisseur,
others more negligently put together to strike
the fancy of a common beholder.' Pope&mdash;who reflects the
most various schools of criticism, often on successive pages&mdash;illustrates
this stage in his remark that Shakespeare has
excellences that have elevated him above all others, and
almost as many defects; 'as he has certainly written better
so he has perhaps written worse than any other.' Dr. Johnson
sets out by describing Shakespeare as 'having begun
to assume the dignity of an ancient'&mdash;the highest commendation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>in his eyes. But he goes on to point out the
inferiority of Shakespeare's Tragedy to his Comedy, the
former the outcome of skill rather than instinct, with little
felicity and always leaving something wanting; how he
seems without moral purpose, letting his precepts and
axioms drop casually from him, dismissing his personages
without further care, and leaving the examples to operate by
chance; how his plots are so loosely formed that they might
easily be improved, his set speeches cold and weak, his
incidents imperfectly told in many words which might be
more plainly described in few. Then in the progress of his
commentary, he irritates the reader, as Hallam points out,
by the magisterial manner in which he dismisses each play
like a schoolboy's exercise.<span class="sidenote">
5. <em>Finally
criticism
comes
round entirely
to
Shakespeare.</em></span>&mdash;At last comes a revolution in
criticism and a new order of things arises: with Lessing
to lead the way in Germany and Coleridge in England, a
school of critics appear who are in complete harmony with
their author, who question him only to learn the secrets
of his art. The new spirit has not even yet leavened the
whole of the literary world; but such names as Goethe,
Tieck, Schlegel, Victor Hugo, Ulrici, Gervinus suggest how
many great reputations have been made, and reputations
already great have been carried into a new sphere of greatness,
by the interpretation and unfolding of Shakespeare's
greatness: not one critic has in recent years risen to
eminence by attacking Shakespeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Other examples.</em></div>

<p>And the Shakespearean Drama is only the most illustrious
example of authors triumphing over the criticism that attempted
to judge them. It is difficult for a modern reader
to believe that even Rymer could refer to <span class="sidenote"><em>Milton.</em></span>the <em>Paradise Lost</em>
as 'what some are pleased to call a poem'; or that Dr.
Johnson could assert of the minor poems of Milton that
they exhibit 'peculiarity as distinguished from excellence,'
'if they differ from others they differ for the worse.' He
says of <em>Comus</em> that it is 'inelegantly splendid and tediously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>instructive'; and of <em>Lycidas</em>, that its diction is harsh, its
rhymes uncertain, its numbers unpleasing, that 'in this poem
there is no nature for there is no truth, there is no art for
there is nothing new,' that it is 'easy, vulgar, and therefore
disgusting,'&mdash;after which he goes through the different parts
of the poem to show what Milton should have done in each.
Hallam has pointed out how utterly impotent Dr. Johnson
has been to fix the public taste in the case of these poems;
yet even Hallam could think the verse of the poet who wrote
<em>Paradise Lost</em> sufficiently described by the verdict, 'sometimes
wanting in grace and almost always in ease.' <span class="sidenote"><em>Shakespeare's
Sonnets.</em></span>In the
light of modern taste it is astonishing indeed to find
Steevens, with his devotion of a lifetime to Shakespeare, yet
omitting the Sonnets from the edition of 1793, 'because the
strongest Act of Parliament that could be framed would not
compel readers into their service.' <span class="sidenote"><em>Spenser.</em></span>It is equally astonishing
to find Dryden speaking of Spenser's 'ill choice of stanza,'
and saying of the <em>Faerie Queene</em> that if completed it might
have been more of a piece, but it could not be perfect, because
its model was not true: an example followed up in
the next century by a 'person of quality,' who translated a
book of the <em>Faerie Queene</em> out of its 'obsolete language and
manner of verse' into heroic couplets. <span class="sidenote"><em>Gray.</em></span>I pass over the
crowd of illustrations, such as the fate of Gray at the hands
of Dr. Johnson, <span class="sidenote"><em>Keats.</em></span>of Keats at the hands of monthly and
quarterly reviewers, <span class="sidenote"><em>Waverley
Novels.</em></span>or of the various Waverley Novels capriciously
selected by different critics as examples of literary
suicide. But we have not yet had time to forget how Jeffrey&mdash;one
of the greatest names in criticism&mdash;set in motion the
whole machinery of reviewing in order to put down Wordsworth.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Wordsworth.</em></span>Wordsworth's most elaborate poem he describes as
a 'tissue of moral and devotional ravings,' a 'hubbub of
strained raptures and fantastical sublimities': his 'effusions
on ... the physiognomy of external nature' he characterises
as 'eminently fantastic, obscure, and affected.' Then, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>find a climax, he compares different species of Wordsworth's
poetry to the various stages of intoxication: his Odes are
'glorious delirium' and 'incoherent rapture,' his Lyrical
Ballads a 'vein of pretty deliration,' his <em>White Doe</em> is 'low
and maudlin imbecility.' Not a whit the less has the influence
of Wordsworth deepened and solidified; and if all
are not yet prepared to accept him as the apostle of a new
religion, yet he has tacitly secured his place in the inner
circle of English poets. In fine, the work of modern criticism
is seriously blocked by the perpetual necessity of
revising and reversing what this same Jeffrey calls the 'impartial
and irreversible sentences' of criticism in the past.
And as a set-off in the opposite scale only one considerable
achievement is to be noted: <span class="sidenote"><em>Robert
Montgomery.</em></span>that journalism afforded a
medium for Macaulay to quench the light of Robert Montgomery,
which, on Macaulay's own showing, journalism had
puffed into a flame.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Defeat of
criticism
in the great
literary
questions.</em></div>

<p>It is the same with the great literary questions that have
from time to time arisen, the pitched battles of criticism: as
Goldsmith says, there never has been an unbeaten path
trodden by the poet that the critic has not endeavoured to
recall him by calling his attempt an innovation. <span class="sidenote"><em>Blank
verse.</em></span>Criticism
set its face steadily from the first against blank verse in
English poetry. The interlocutors in Dryden's <em>Essay on the
Drama</em> agree that it is vain to strive against the stream of
the people's inclination, won over as they have been by
Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher; but, as
they go on to discuss the rights of the matter, the most
remarkable thing to a modern reader is that the defence of
blank verse is made to rest only on the colloquial character
of dramatic poetry, and neither party seems to conceive the
possibility of non-dramatic poetry other than in rhyme. Before
Dryden's <em>Essay on Satire</em> the <em>Paradise Lost</em> had made
its appearance; but so impossible an idea is literary novelty
to the 'father of English criticism' that Dryden in this Essay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>refuses to believe Milton's own account of the matter, saying
that, whatever reasons Milton may allege for departing from
rhyme, 'his own particular reason is plainly this, that rhyme
was not his talent, he has neither the ease of doing it nor
the graces of it.' To one so steeped in French fashions as
Rymer, poetry that lacks rhyme seems to lack everything;
many of Shakespeare's scenes might, he says, do better
without words at all, or at most the words set off the action
like the drone of a bagpipe. Voltaire estimates blank verse
at about the same rate, and having to translate some of
Shakespeare's for purposes of exact comparison, he remarks
that blank verse costs nothing but the trouble of dictating,
that it is not more difficult to write than a letter. Dr. Johnson
finds a theoretic argument in the unmusical character of
English poetry to prove the impossibility of its ever adapting
itself to the conditions of blank verse, and is confident
enough to prophesy: 'poetry may subsist without rhyme,
but English poetry will not often please.' Even Byron is
found only one degree more tolerant than Dryden: he has
the grace to except Milton from his dictum that no one ever
wrote blank verse who could rhyme. Thus critical taste,
critical theory, and critical prophecy were unanimous against
blank verse as an English measure: for all that it has become
the leading medium of English poetry, and a doubter
of to-day would be more likely to doubt the permanence of
English rhyme than of English blank verse. <span class="sidenote"><em>The 'three
unities':</em></span>As to the
famous 'three unities,' not only the principles themselves, but
even the refutation of them has now become obsolete. Yet
this stickling for the unities has been merely the chief
amongst many examples of the proneness the critical mind
has exhibited towards limiting literary appreciation and production
by single standards of taste. <span class="sidenote"><em>and limitations
by
still narrower
classical
standards.</em></span>The same tone of
mind that contended for the classical unities had in an
earlier generation contended for the classical languages as
the sole vehicle of literary expression, and the modern languages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>of Europe had to assert their rights by hard fighting.
In Latin literature itself a more successful attempt has been
made to limit taste by the writers of a single period, the
Augustan age, and so construct a list of Latin poets which
omits Lucretius. And for a short period of the Renaissance
movement the limitation was carried further to a single one
of the Augustan writers, and 'Ciceronianism' struggled hard
against the freedom of style it chose to nickname 'Apuleianism,'
till it fell itself before the laughter of Erasmus. <span class="sidenote">
<em>Criticism
failing to
distinguish
the permanent
and transitory.</em></span>It would seem almost to be a radical law of the critical temperament
that admiration for the past paralyses faith in the
future; while criticism proves totally unable to distinguish
between what has been essential in the greatness of its idols
and what has been as purely accidental as, to use Scott's
illustration, the shape of the drinking-glass is to the flavour
of the wine it contains. And if criticism has thus failed in
distinguishing what is permanent in past literature, it has
proved equally mistaken in what it has assumed to be accidental
and transitory. Early commentators on Shakespeare,
whatever scruples they may have had upon other points, had
no misgivings in condemning the irregularities of his English
and correcting his grammar. This was described as obsolete
by Dryden half a century after the poet's death; while it
is delicious to hear Steevens, in the Advertisement to his
edition of 1766, mentioning that 'some have been of opinion
that even a particular syntax prevailed in the time of Shakespeare'&mdash;a
novel suggestion he promptly rejects. If the two
could have lived each a century later, Dryden would have
found Malone laying down that Shakespeare had been the
great purifyer and refiner of our language, and Steevens
would have seen Shakespeare's grammar studied with the
same minuteness and reduced to the same regular form as
the grammar of his commentators and readers; while one of
the most distinguished of our modern grammarians, instituting
a comparison between Elizabethan and nineteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>century English, fancies the representative of the old-fashioned
tongue characterising current speech in the words
of Sebastian:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">Surely</div>
<div class="i0">It is a sleepy language!</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><em>Critical
works
where inductive
retain their
force, where
judicial
have become
obsolete.</em></div>

<p>The critics may themselves be called as chief witnesses
against themselves. Those parts of their works in which
they apply themselves to analysing and interpreting their
authors survive in their full force: where they judge, find
fault, and attempt to regulate, they inevitably become obsolete.
Aristotle, the founder of all criticism, is for the
most part inductive in his method, describing poetry as it
existed in his day, distinguishing its different classes and
elements, and tabulating its usages: accordingly Aristotle's
treatise, though more than two thousand years old, remains
the text-book of the Greek Drama. In some places, however,
he diverges from his main purpose, as in the final
chapter, in which he raises the question whether Epic or
Tragic is more excellent, or where he promises a special
treatise to discuss whether Tragedy is yet perfect: here he
has for modern readers only the interest of curiosity. Dr.
Johnson's analysis of 'metaphysical poetry,' Addison's development
of the leading effects in <em>Paradise Lost</em>, remain as
true and forcible to-day as when they were written: Addison
constructing an order of merit for English poets with Cowley
and Sprat at the head, Dr. Johnson lecturing Shakespeare
and Milton as to how they ought to have written&mdash;these are
to us only odd anachronisms. It is like a contest with
atomic force, this attempt at using ideas drawn from the past
to mould and limit productive power in the present and
future. The critic peers into the dimness of history, and is
found to have been blind to what was by his side: Boileau
strives to erect a throne of Comedy for Terence, and never
suspects that a truer king was at hand in his own personal
friend Molière. It is in vain for critics to denounce, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>denunciation recoils on themselves: the sentence of Rymer
that the soul of modern Drama was a brutish and not a
reasonable soul, or of Voltaire, that Shakespeare's Tragedy
would not be tolerated by the lowest French mob, can harm
none but Rymer and Voltaire. If the critics venture to
prophesy, the sequel is the only refutation of them needed;
if they give reasons, the reasons survive only to explain how
the critics were led astray; if they lay down laws, literary
greatness in the next generation is found to vary directly
with the boldness with which authors violate the laws. If
they assume a judicial attitude, the judgment-seat becomes
converted into a pillory for the judge, and a comic side to
literary history is furnished by the mockery with which time
preserves the proportions of things, as seen by past criticism,
to be laid side by side with the true perspective revealed by
actual history. In such wise it has preserved to us the list
of 'poets laureate' who preceded Southey: Shadwell, Tate,
Rowe, Eusden, Cibber, Whitehead, Warton, Pye. It reveals
Dryden sighing that Spenser could only have read the rules
of Bossu, or smitten with a doubt whether he might not after
all excuse Milton's use of blank verse 'by the example of
Hannibal Caro'; Rymer preferring Ben Jonson's <em>Catiline</em>
to all the tragedies of the Elizabethan age, and declaring
Waller's <em>Poem on the Navy Royal</em> beyond all modern poetry
in any language; Voltaire wondering that the extravagances
of Shakespeare could be tolerated by a nation that had seen
Addison's <em>Cato</em>; Pope assigning three-score years and ten as
the limit of posthumous life to 'moderns' in poetry, and
celebrating the trio who had rescued from the 'uncivilised'
Elizabethan poetry the 'fundamental laws of wit.' These three
are Buckingham, Roscommon, and Walsh: as to the last
of whom if we search amongst contemporary authorities to
discover who he was, we at last come upon his works described
in the <em>Rambler</em> as 'pages of inanity.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>In actual
practice
criticism is
found to
have
gradually
approached
induction.</em></div>

<p>But in the conflict between judicial criticism and science
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>the most important point is to note how the critics' own
ideas of criticism are found to be gradually slipping away
from them. Between the Renaissance and the present day
criticism, as judged by the methods actually followed by
critics, has slowly changed from the form of laying down
laws to authors into the form of receiving laws from authors.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Five stages.
1. Idea of
judging
solely by
classical
standards.</em></span>The process of change falls into five stages. In its first
stage the conception of criticism was bounded by the notion
of comparing whatever was produced with the masterpieces
and trying it by the ideas of Greek and Roman literature.
Boileau objected to Corneille's tragedies, not because they
did not excite admiration, but because admiration was not
one of the tragical passions as laid down by Aristotle. To
Rymer's mind it was clearly a case of classical standards or
no standards, and he describes his opponents as 'a kind of
stage-quacks and empirics in poetry who have got a receipt
to please.' And there is a degree of <em>naïveté</em> in the way in
which Bossu betrays his utter unconsciousness of the possibility
that there should be more than one kind of excellence,
where, in a passage in which he is admitting that the
moderns have as much spirit and as lucky fancies as the
ancients, he nevertheless calls it 'a piece of injustice to pretend
that our new rules destroy the fancies of the old
masters, and that they must condemn all their works who
could not foresee all our humours.' Criticism in this spirit
is notably illustrated by the Corneille incident in the history
of the French Academy. The fashionable literary world,
led by a Scudéry, solemnly impeach Corneille of originality,
and Richelieu insists on the Academy pronouncing judgment;
which they at last do, unwillingly enough, since, as
Boileau admitted, all France was against them. The only
one that in the whole incident retained his sense of humour
was the victim himself; who, early in the struggle, being
confronted by critics recognising no merit but that of
obedience to rules, set himself to write his <em>Clitandre</em> as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>play which should obey all the rules of Drama and yet have
nothing in it: 'in which,' he said, 'I have absolutely succeeded.'<span class="sidenote">2. <em>Recognition
of
modern as
illegitimate
merit.</em></span>&mdash;But
this reign of simple faith began to be disturbed
by sceptical doubts: it became impossible entirely to
ignore merit outside the pale of classical conformity. Thus
we get a Dennis unable to conceal his admiration for the
daring of Milton, as a man who knew the rules of Aristotle,
'no man better,' and yet violated them. Literature of the
modern type gets discussed as it were under protest. Dr.
Johnson, when he praises Addison's <em>Cato</em> for adhering to
Aristotle's principles 'with a <em>scrupulousness</em> almost unexampled
on the English stage,' is reflecting the constant
assumption throughout this transitional stage, that departure
from classical models is the result of carelessness, and that
beauties in such offending writers are lucky hits. The spirit
of this period is distinctly brought out by Dr. Johnson where
he 'readily allows' that the union in one composition of
serious and ludicrous is 'contrary to the rules of criticism,'
but, he adds, 'there is always an appeal open from criticism
to nature.'<span class="sidenote">3. <em>Modern
standards
of judging
side by
side with
ancient.</em></span>&mdash;Once admitted to examination the force of
modern literature could not fail to assert its equality with the
literature of the ancients, and we pass into a third stage of
criticism when critics grasp the conception that there may
be more than one set of rules by which authors may be
judged. The new notion made its appearance early in the
country which was the main stronghold of the opposite view.
Perrault in 1687 instituted his 'Parallels' between the
ancients and the moderns to the advantage of the latter;
and the question was put in its naked simplicity by Fontenelle,
the 'Nestor of literature,' when he made it depend
upon another question, 'whether the trees that used to grow
in our woods were larger than those which grow now.'
Later, and with less distinctness, English criticism followed
the lead. Pope, with his happy indifference to consistency,
after illustrating the first stage where he advises to write 'as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>if the Stagirite o'erlooked each line,' and where he contends
that if the classical authors indulge in a licence that licence
becomes a law to us, elsewhere lays down that to apply
ancient rules in the treatment of modern literature is to try
by the laws of one country a man belonging to another. In
one notable instance the genius of Dr. Johnson rises
superior to the prejudices of his age, and he vindicates in
his treatment of Shakespeare the conception of a school of
Drama in which the unities of time and place do not apply.
But he does it with trembling: 'I am almost frightened at
my own temerity; and when I estimate the fame and the
strength of those who maintain the contrary opinion, am
ready to sink down in reverential silence.'<span class="sidenote">4. <em>Conception
of
criticism
as judging
begins to
waver:</em></span>&mdash;Criticism had set
out with judging by one set of laws, it had come to judge by
two: the change began to shake the notion of <em>judging</em> as the
function of criticism, and the eyes of critics came to be
turned more to the idea of literary beauty itself, as the end
for which the laws of literary composition were merely
means. Addison is the great name connected with this
further transitional stage. We find Addison not only arguing
negatively that 'there is sometimes a greater judgment
shown in deviating from the rules of art than in adhering
to them,' <span class="sidenote"><em>changing to
the search
for beauties:</em></span>but even laying down as a positive theory
that the true function of a critic is 'to discover the concealed
beauties of a writer'; while the practical illustration of his
theory which he gave in the case of the <em>Paradise Lost</em> is
supposed to have revolutionised the opinion of the fashionable
reading-public.<span class="sidenote">5. <em>and
finally to
investigation
of laws
in literature
as it
stands.</em></span>&mdash;Addison was removed by a very little
from the final stage of criticism, the conception of which is
perhaps most fully brought out by Gervinus, where he declares
his purpose of treating Shakespeare as the 'revealing
genius' of his department of art and of its laws. Thus
slowly and by gradual stages has the conception of criticism
been changing in the direction of induction: starting from
judgment by the laws of the ancient classics as standards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>beyond which there is no appeal, passing through the
transitional stage of greater and greater toleration for intrinsic
worth though of a modern type, to arrive at the
recognition of modern standards of judgment side by side
with ancient; again passing through a further transitional
stage of discrediting judgment altogether as the purpose of
criticism in favour of the search for intrinsic worth in literature
as it stands, till the final conception is reached of analysing
literature as it stands for the purpose of discovering
its laws in itself. The later stages do not universally prevail
yet. But the earlier stages have at all events become obsolete;
and there is no reader who will not acquiesce cheerfully
in one of the details Addison gives out for his ideal theatre,
by which Rymer's tragedy <em>Edgar</em> was to be cut up into snow
to make the Storm Scene in Shakespeare's <em>Lear</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Separateness
of the
two
criticisms.</em></div>

<p>It may be well to recall the exact purpose to which the
present argument is intended to lead. The purpose is not
to attack journalism and kindred branches of criticism in
the interests of inductive treatment. It would be false to the
principles of induction not to recognise that the criticism of
taste has long since established its position as a fertile branch
of literature. Even in an inductive system journalism would still
have place as a medium for fragmentary and tentative treatment.
Moreover it may be admitted that induction in its
formal completeness of system can never be applied in practical
life; and in the intellectual pursuits of real life trained
literary taste may be a valuable acquisition. What is here
attacked is the mistake which has identified the criticism of
taste and valuation with the conception of criticism as a
whole; the intrusion of methods belonging to journalism into
treatment that claims to be systematic. <span class="sidenote"><em>Criticism
of taste
belongs to
creative
literature:</em></span>So far from being a
standard of method in the treatment of literature, criticism of
the reviewer's order is outside science altogether. It finds
its proper place on the creative side of literature, as a branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>in which literature itself has come to be taken as a theme for
literary writing; it thus belongs to the literature treated, not
to the scientific treatment of it. <span class="sidenote"><em>as the
lyrics of
prose.</em></span>Reviews so placed may be
regarded almost as the lyrics of prose: like lyric poems
they have their completeness in themselves, and their interest
lies, not in their being parts of some whole, but in their
flashing the subjectivity of a writer on to a variety of isolated
topics; they thus have value, not as fragments of literary
science, but as fragments of Addison, of Jeffrey, of Macaulay.
Nor is the bearing of the present argument that commentators
should set themselves to eulogise the authors they treat
instead of condemning them (though this would certainly be
the safer of two errors). The treatment aimed at is one independent
of praise or blame, one that has nothing to do with
merit, relative or absolute. The contention is for a branch
of criticism separate from the criticism of taste; a branch
that, in harmony with the spirit of other modern sciences,
reviews the phenomena of literature as they actually stand,
enquiring into and endeavouring to systematise the laws and
principles by which they are moulded and produce their effects.
Scientific criticism and the criticism of taste have distinct
spheres: and the whole of literary history shows that the failure
to keep the two separate results only in mutual confusion.</p>

<p>Our present purpose is with inductive criticism. What, by
the analogy of other sciences, is implied in the inductive
treatment of literature?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Application
of induction
to
literary
subject-matter.</em></div>

<p>The inductive sciences occupy themselves directly with
facts, that is, with phenomena translated by observation into
the form of facts; and soundness of inductive theory is
measured by the closeness with which it will bear confronting
with the facts. In the case of literature and art the facts
are to be looked for in the literary and artistic productions
themselves: the dramas, epics, pictures, statues, pillars,
capitals, symphonies, operas&mdash;the details of these are the
phenomena which the critical observer translates into facts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>A picture is a title for a bundle of facts: that the painter has
united so many figures in such and such groupings, that he
has given such and such varieties of colouring, and such and
such arrangement of light and shade. Similarly the <em>Iliad</em> is
a short name implying a large number of facts characterising
the poem: that its principal personages are Agamemnon
and Achilles, that these personages are represented as displaying
certain qualities, doing certain deeds, and standing
in certain relations to one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Difficulty:
the want
of positiveness
in
literary impressions.</em></div>

<p>Here, however, arises that which has been perhaps the
greatest stumbling-block in the way of securing inductive
treatment for literature. Science deals only with ascertained
facts: but the details of literature and art are open to the
most diverse interpretation. They leave conflicting impressions
on different observers, impressions both subjective and
variable in themselves, and open to all manner of distracting
influences, not excepting that of criticism itself. Where in
the treatment of literature is to be found the positiveness of
subject-matter which is the first condition of science?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The difficulty
not
confined to
literature.</em></div>

<p>In the first place it may be pointed out that this want of
certainty in literary interpretation is not a difficulty of a kind
peculiar to literature. The same object of terror will affect
the members of a crowd in a hundred different ways, from
presence of mind to hysteria; yet this has not prevented the
science of psychology from inductively discussing fear. Logic
proposes to scientifically analyse the reasoning processes in
the face of the infinite degrees of susceptibility different
minds show to proof and persuasion. It has become proverbial
that taste in art is incapable of being settled by discussion,
yet the art of music has found exact treatment in the
science of harmony. In the case of these well-established
sciences it has been found possible to separate the variable
element from that which is the subject-matter of the science:
such a science as psychology really covers two distinct
branches of thought, the psychology that discusses formally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>the elements of the human mind, and another psychology,
not yet systematised, that deals with the distribution of these
elements amongst different individuals. It need then be no
barrier to inductive treatment that in the case of literature
and art the will and consciousness act as disturbing forces,
refracting what may be called natural effects into innumerable
effects on individual students. It only becomes a question
of practical procedure, in what way the interfering variability
is to be eliminated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The variable
element
to be
eliminated
by reference
not to taste;</em></div>

<p>It is precisely at this point that <em>à priori</em> criticism and induction
part company. The <em>à priori</em> critic gets rid of
uncertainty in literary interpretation by confining his attention
to effects produced upon the best minds: he sets up
<em>taste</em> as a standard by which to try impressions of literature
which he is willing to consider. The inductive critic cannot
have recourse to any such arbitrary means of limiting his
materials; for his doubts he knows no court of appeal except
the appeal to the literary works themselves. <span class="sidenote"><em>but to the
objective
details of
the literature
itself.</em></span>The
astronomer, from the vast distance of the objects he observes,
finds the same phenomenon producing different results on
different observers, and he has thus regularly to allow for
personal errors: but he deals with such discrepancies only
by fresh observations on the stars themselves, and it never
occurs to him that he can get rid of a variation by abstract
argument or deference to a greater observer. In the
same way the inductive critic of literature must settle his
doubts by referring them to the literary productions themselves;
to him the question is not of the nobler view or the
view in best taste, but simply what view fits in best with the
details as they stand in actual fact. He quite recognises that
it is not the objective details but the subjective impressions
they produce that make literary effect, but the objective details
are the <em>limit</em> on the variability of the subjective impressions.
The character of Macbeth impresses two readers
differently: how is the difference to be settled? The <em>à priori</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>critic contends that his conception is the loftier; that a hero
should be heroic; that moreover the tradition of the stage
and the greatest names in the criticism of the past bear him
out; or, finally, falls back upon good taste, which closes the
discussion. The inductive critic simply puts together all the
sayings and doings of Macbeth himself, all that others in the
play say and appear to feel about him, and whatever view of
the character is consistent with these and similar facts of
the play, that view he selects; while to vary from it for any
external consideration would seem to him as futile as for an
astronomer to make a star rise an hour earlier to tally with
the movements of another star.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Foundation
axiom
of the inductive
criticism:
Interpretation
of
the nature
of an hypothesis.</em></div>

<p>We thus arrive at a foundation axiom of inductive literary
criticism: <em>Interpretation in literature is of the nature of a
scientific hypothesis, the truth of which is tested by the degree of
completeness with which it explains the details of the literary
work as they actually stand</em>. That will be the true meaning
of a passage, not which is the most worthy, but which most
nearly explains the words as they are; that will be the true
reading of a character which, however involved in expression
or tame in effect, accounts for and reconciles all that is represented
of the personage. The inductive critic will interpret
a complex situation, not by fastening attention on its striking
elements and ignoring others as oversights and blemishes,
but by putting together with business-like exactitude all that
the author has given, weighing, balancing, and standing by
the product. He will not consider that he has solved the
action of a drama by some leading plot, or some central idea
powerfully suggested in different parts, but will investigate
patiently until he can find a scheme which will give point to
the inferior as well as to the leading scenes, and in connection
with which all the details are harmonised in their proper
proportions. In this way he will be raising a superstructure
of exposition that rests, not on authority however high, but
upon a basis of indisputable fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Practical
objection:
Did the
authors
intend
those interpretations?</em></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
In actual operation I have often found that such positive
analysis raises in the popular mind a very practical objection:
that the scientific interpretation seems to discover in literary
works much more in the way of purpose and design than the
authors themselves can be supposed to have dreamed of.
Would not Chaucer and Shakespeare, it is asked, if they
could come to life now, be greatly astonished to hear themselves
lectured upon? to find critics knowing their purposes
better than they had known them themselves, and discovering
in their works laws never suspected till after they were dead,
and which they themselves perhaps would need some effort
to understand? Deep designs are traced in Shakespeare's
plots, and elaborate combinations in his characters and
passions: is the student asked to believe that Shakespeare
really <em>intended</em> these complicated effects?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Answer:
changed
meaning of
'design'
in science.</em></div>

<p>The difficulty rests largely upon a confusion in words.
Such words as 'purpose,' 'intention,' have a different sense
when used in ordinary parlance from that which they bear
when applied in criticism and science. In ordinary parlance
a man's 'purpose' means his conscious purpose, of which he
is the best judge; in science the 'purpose' of a thing is the
purpose it actually serves, and is discoverable only by analysis.
Thus science discovers that the 'purpose' of earthworms is
to break up the soil, the 'design' of colouring in flowers is
to attract insects, though the flower is not credited with fore-sight
nor the worm with disinterestedness. In this usage
alone can the words 'purpose,' 'intention,' be properly applied
to literature and art: science knows no kind of evidence in
the matter of creative purpose so weighty as the thing it has
actually produced. This has been well put by Ulrici:</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>The <em>language</em> of the artist is poetry, music, drawing, colouring:
there is no other form in which he can express himself with equal depth
and clearness. Who would ask a philosopher to paint his ideas in
colours? It would be equally absurd to think that because a poet
cannot say with perfect philosophic certainty in the form of reflection
and pure thought what it was that he wished and intended to produce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>that he never thought at all, but let his imagination improvise at
random.</p></div>

<p>Nothing is more common than for analysis to discover
design in what, so far as consciousness is concerned, has
been purely instinctive. Thus physiology ascertains that
bread contains all the necessary elements of food except one,
which omission happens to be supplied by butter: this may
be accepted as an explanation of our 'purpose' in eating
butter with bread, without the explanation being taken to
imply that all who have ever fed on bread and butter
have consciously <em>intended</em> to combine the nitrogenous and
oleaginous elements of food. It is the natural order of
things that the practical must precede the analytic. Bees by
instinct construct hexagonal cells, and long afterwards
mensuration shows that the hexagon is the most economic
shape for such stowage; individual states must rise and fall
first before the sciences of history and politics can come to
explain the how and why of their mutations. Similarly it is
in accordance with the order of things that Shakespeare should
produce dramas by the practical processes of art-creation, and
that it should be left for others, his critics succeeding him at
long intervals, to discover by analysis his 'purposes' and the
laws which underlie his effects. The poet, if he could come
to life now, would not feel more surprise at this analysis of
his 'motives' and unfolding of his unconscious 'design' than
he would feel on hearing that the beating of his heart&mdash;to
him a thing natural enough, and needing no explanation&mdash;had
been discovered to have a distinct purpose he could
never have dreamed of in propelling the circulation of his
blood, a thing of which he had never heard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Three
points of
contrast
between
judicial
and inductive
criticism.</em></div>

<p>There are three leading ideas in relation to which inductive
and judicial criticism are in absolute antagonism: to bring
out these contrasts will be the most effective way of describing
the inductive treatment.</p>

<p>The first of these ideas is order of merit, together with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>kindred notions of partisanship and hostility applied to individual
authors and works.
<span class="sidenote">1.
<em>Comparisons
of
merit:
these outside
science.</em></span>The minds of ordinary readers
are saturated with this class of ideas; they are the weeds of
taste, choking the soil, and leaving no room for the purer
forms of literary appreciation. Favoured by the fatal blunder
of modern education, which considers every other mental
power to stand in need of training, but leaves taste and
imagination to shift for themselves, literary taste has largely
become confused with a spurious form of it: the mere taste
for competition, comparison of likes and dislikes, gossip
applied to art and called criticism. Of course such likes and
dislikes must always exist, and journalism is consecrated to
the office of giving them shape and literary expression;
though it should be led by experience, if by nothing else, to
exercise its functions with a double reserve, recognising that
the judicial attitude of mind is a limit on appreciation, and
that the process of testing will itself be tried by the test of
vitality. But such preferences and comparisons of merit
must be kept rigidly outside the sphere of science. Science
knows nothing of competitive examination: a geologist is
not heard extolling old red sandstone as a model rock-formation,
or making sarcastic comments on the glacial
epoch. Induction need not disturb the freedom with which
we attach ourselves to whatever attracts our individual dispositions:
individual partisanship for the wooded snugness
of the Rhine or the bold and bracing Alps is unaffected by
the adoption of exact methods in physical geography. What
is to be avoided is the confusion of two different kinds of
interest attaching to the same object. In the study of the
stars and the rocks, which can inspire little or no personal
interest, it is easy to keep science pure; to keep it to 'dry
light,' as Heraclitus calls it, intelligence unclouded by the
humours of individual sentiment, as Bacon interprets. But
when science comes to be applied to objects which can excite
emotion and inspire affection, then confusion arises, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>scientific student of political economy finds his treatment of
pauperism disturbed by the philanthropy which belongs to
him as a man. Still more in so emotional an atmosphere as
the study of beauty, the student must use effort to separate
the <em>beauty</em> of an object, which is a thing of art and perfectly
analysable, from his personal <em>interest</em> in it, which is as distinctly
external to the analysis of beauty as his love for his
dog is external to the science of zoology. The possibility of
thus separating interest and perception of beauty without
diminishing either may be sufficiently seen in the case of
music&mdash;an art which has been already reduced to scientific
form. Music is as much as any art a thing of tastes and
preferences; besides partialities for particular masters one
student will be peculiarly affected by melody, another is all
for dramatic effect, others have a special taste for the fugue
or the sonata. No one can object to such preferences, but
the science of music knows nothing about them; its exposition
deals with modes of treatment or habits of orchestration
distinguishing composers, irrespective of the private partialities
they excite. Mozart and Wagner are analysed as two items
in the sum of facts which make up music; and if a particular
expositor shows by a turn in the sentence that he has a leaning
to one or the other, the slip may do no harm, but for the
moment science has been dropped.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Inductive
treatment
concerned
with differences
of
kind, not of
degree.</em></div>

<p>There is, however, a sort of difference between authors and
works, the constant recognition of which would more than
make up to cultured pleasure for discarding comparisons of
merit. Inductive treatment is concerned with <em>differences of
kind</em> as distinguished from differences of degree. Elementary
as this distinction is, the power of firmly grasping it is no
slight evidence of a trained mind: the power, that is, of clearly
seeing that two things are different, without being at the same
time impelled to rank one above the other. The confusion
of the two is a constant obstacle in the way of literary appreciation.
It has been said, by way of comparison between two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>great novelists, that George Eliot constructs characters, but
Charlotte Brontë creates them. The description (assuming
it to be true) ought to shed a flood of interest upon both
authoresses; by perpetually throwing on the two modes of
treatment the clear light of contrast it ought to intensify our
appreciation of both. As a fact, however, the description is
usually quoted to suggest a preference for Charlotte Brontë
on the supposed ground that creation is 'higher' than construction;
and the usual consequences of preferences are
threatened&mdash;the gradual closing of our susceptibilities to those
qualities in the less liked of the two which do not resemble
the qualities of the favourite. Yet why should we not be
content to accept such a description (if true) as constituting
a difference of kind, and proceed to recognise 'construction'
and 'creation' as two parallel modes of treatment, totally
distinct from one another in the way in which a fern is distinct
from a flower, a distinction allowing no room for preferences
because there is no common ground on which to compare?
This separateness once granted, the mind, instead of
having to choose between the two, would have scope for
taking in to the full the detailed effects flowing from both
modes of treatment, and the area of mental pleasure would be
enlarged. The great blunders of criticism in the past, which
are now universally admitted, rest on this inability to recognise
differences of kind in literature. The Restoration poets had
a mission to bring the heroic couplet to perfection: poetry
not in their favourite measure they treated, not as different,
but as bad, and rewrote or ignored Spenser and Milton. And
generations of literary history have been wasted in discussing
whether the Greek dramatists or Shakespeare were the higher:
now every one recognises that they constitute two schools
different in kind that cannot be compared.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Distinctions
of
kind a primary
element
in appreciation.</em></div>

<p>It is hardly going too far to assert that this sensitiveness to
differences of kind as distinguished from differences of degree
is the first condition of literary appreciation. Nothing can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>more essential to art-perception than receptiveness, and
receptiveness implies a change in the receptive attitude of
mind with each variety of art. To illustrate by an extreme
case. Imagine a spectator perfectly familiar with the Drama,
but to whom the existence of the Opera was unknown, and
suppose him to have wandered into an opera-house, mistaking
it for a theatre. At first the mistake under which he
was labouring would distort every effect: the elaborate overture
would seem to him a great 'waste' of power in what was
a mere accessory; the opening recitative would strike him as
'unnaturally' delivered, and he would complain of the
orchestral accompaniment as a 'distraction'; while at the
first aria he would think the actor gone mad. As, however,
arias, terzettos, recitatives succeeded one another, he must at
last catch the idea that the music was an essential element in
the exhibition, and that he was seeing, not a drama, but a
drama translated into a different kind of art. The catching
of this idea would at once make all the objectionable elements
fall into their proper places. No longer distracted by the
thought of the ordinary Drama, his mind would have leisure
to catch the special effects of the Opera: he would feel how
powerfully a change of passion could move him when magnified
with all the range of expression an orchestra affords, and
he would acknowledge a dramatic touch as the diabolic spirit
of the conspirator found vent in a double D. The illustration
is extreme to the extent of absurdity: but it brings out how
expectation plays an important part in appreciation, and how
the expectation has to be adapted to that on which it is exercised.
The receptive attitude is a sort of mental focus which
needs adjusting afresh to each variety of art if its effects are
to be clearly caught; and to disturb attention when engaged
on one species of literature by the thought of another is as
unreasonable as to insist on one microscopic object appearing
definite when looked at with a focus adjusted to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>object.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Each
author
a separate
species.</em></span>This will be acknowledged in reference to the great
divisions of art: but does it not apply to the species as well as
the genera, indeed to each individual author? Wordsworth
has laid down that each fresh poet is to be tried by fresh
canons of taste: this is only another way of saying that the
differences between poets are differences of kind, that each
author is a 'school' by himself, and can be appreciated only
by a receptive attitude formed by adjustment to himself alone.
In a scientific treatment of literature, at all events, an elementary
axiom must be: <span class="sidenote"><em>Second
axiom of
inductive
criticism:
its function
in distinguishing
literary
species.</em></span><em>That inductive criticism is mainly
occupied in distinguishing literary species</em>. And on this view
it will clearly appear how such notions as order of merit
become disturbing forces in literary appreciation: unconsciously
they apply the <em>qualitative</em> standard of the favourite
works to works which must necessarily be explained by
a different standard. They are defended on the ground of
pleasure, but they defeat their own object: no element in
pleasure is greater than variety, and comparisons of merit,
with every other form of the judicial spirit, are in reality
arrangements for appreciating the smallest number of
varieties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II.
<em>The 'laws
of art':
confusion
between
law external
and
scientific.</em></div>

<p>The second is the most important of the three ideas, both
for its effect in the past and for the sharpness with which it
brings judicial and inductive criticism into contrast. It is the
idea that there exist 'laws' of art, in the same sense in which
we speak of laws in morality or the laws of some particular
state&mdash;great principles which have been laid down, and which
are binding on the artist as the laws of God or his country
are binding on the man; that by these, and by lesser principles
deduced from these, the artist's work is to be tried, and praise
or blame awarded accordingly. Great part of formal criticism
runs on these lines; while, next in importance to comparisons
of merit, the popular mind considers literary taste to
consist in a keen sensitiveness to the 'faults' and 'flaws'
of literary workmanship.</p>

<p>This attitude to art illustrates the enormous misleading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>power of the metaphors that lie concealed in words. The
word 'law,' justly applicable in one of its senses to art, has
in practice carried with it the associations of its other sense;
and the mistake of metaphor has been sufficient to distort
criticism until, as Goldsmith remarks, rules have become the
greatest of all the misfortunes which have befallen the commonwealth
of letters. Every expositor has had to point out
the widespread confusion between the two senses of this
term. Laws in the moral and political world are external
obligations, restraints of the will; they exist where the will
of a ruler or of the community is applied to the individual
will. In science, on the other hand, law has to do not with
what ought to be, but with what is; scientific laws are facts
reduced to formulæ, statements of the habits of things, so to
speak. The laws of the stars in the first sense could only
mean some creative fiat, such as 'Let there be lights in the
firmament of heaven'; in the scientific sense laws of the stars
are summaries of their customary movements. In the act of
getting drunk I am violating God's moral law, I am obeying
his law of alcoholic action. So scientific laws, in the case of
art and literature, will mean descriptions of the practice of
artists or the characteristics of their works, when these will go
into the form of general propositions as distinguished from
disconnected details. The key to the distinction is the notion
of external authority. There cannot be laws in the moral and
political sense without a ruler or legislative authority; in
scientific laws the law-giver and the law-obeyer are one and
the same, and for the laws of vegetation science looks no
further than the facts of the vegetable world. <span class="sidenote"><em>The 'laws
of art' are
scientific
laws.</em></span>In literature
and art the term 'law' applies only in the scientific sense;
the laws of the Shakespearean Drama are not laws imposed
by some external authority upon Shakespeare, but laws of
dramatic practice derived from the analysis of his actual
works. Laws of literature, in the sense of external obligations
limiting an author, there are none: if he were voluntarily to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>bind himself by such external laws, he would be so far curtailing
art; it is hardly a paradox to say the art is legitimate
only when it does not obey laws. <span class="sidenote"><em>The word
'fault'
meaningless
in inductive
criticism.</em></span>What applies to the term
'law' applies similarly to the term 'fault.' The term is
likely always to be used from its extreme convenience in art-training;
but it must be understood strictly as a term of education
and discipline. In inductive criticism, as in the other
inductive sciences, the word 'fault' has no meaning. If an
artist acts contrary to the practice of all other artists, the
result is either that he produces no art-effect at all, in which
case there is nothing for criticism to register and analyse, or
else he produces a new effect, and is thus extending, not
breaking, the laws of art. The great clash of horns in
Beethoven's Heroic Symphony was at first denounced as a
gross fault, a violation of the plainest laws of harmony; now,
instead of a 'fault,' it is spoken of as a 'unique effect,' and
in the difference between the two descriptions lies the whole
difference between the conceptions of judicial and inductive
criticism. Again and again in the past this notion of faults
has led criticism on to wrong tracks, from which it has had
to retrace its steps on finding the supposed faults to be in
reality new laws. Immense energy was wasted in denouncing
Shakespeare's 'fault' of uniting serious with light matter in
the same play as a violation of fundamental dramatic laws;
experience showed this mixture of passions to be the source
of powerful art-effects hitherto shut out of the Drama, and the
'fault' became one of the distinguishing 'laws' in the most
famous branch of modern literature. It is necessary then to
insist upon the strict scientific sense of the term 'law' as
used of literature and art; and the purging of criticism from
the confusion attaching to this word is an essential step in its
elevation to the inductive standard. It is a step, moreover,
in which it has been preceded by other branches of thought.
At one time the practice of commerce and the science of
economy suffered under the same confusion: the battle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>'free trade' has been fought, the battle of 'free art' is
still going on. In time it will be recognised that the practice
of artists, like the operations of business, must be left to its
natural working, and the attempt to impose external canons
of taste on artists will appear as futile as the attempt to
effect by legislation the regulation of prices.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Objection
as to the
moral purpose
of
literature:</em></div>

<p>Objections may possibly be taken to this train of argument
on very high grounds, as if the protest against the notion of
law-obeying in art were a sort of antinomianism. Literature,
it may be said, has a moral purpose, to elevate and refine, and
no duty can be higher than that of pointing out what in it is
elevating and refining, and jealously watching against any
lowering of its standard. <span class="sidenote"><em>this outside
inductive
treatment,
though intrinsically
more important.</em></span>Such contention may readily be
granted, and yet may amount to no more than this: that
there are ways of dealing with literature which are more important
than inductive criticism, but which are none the less
outside it. Jeremy Collier did infinite service to our Restoration
Drama, but his was not the service of a scientific critic.
The same things take different ranks as they are tried by the
standards of science or morals. An enervating climate may
have the effect of enfeebling the moral character, but this
does not make the geographer's interest in the tropical zone
one whit the less. Economy concerns itself simply with the
fact that a certain subsidence of profits in a particular trade
will drive away capital to other trades. But the details of
human experience that are latent in such a proposition: the
chilling effects of unsuccess and the dim colour it gives to the
outlook into the universe, the sifting of character and separation
between the enterprising and the simple, the hard
thoughts as to the mysterious dispensations of human prosperity,
the sheer misery of a wage-class looking on plenty and
feeling starvation&mdash;this human drama of failing profits may
be vastly more important than the whole science of economy,
but economy none the less entirely and rightly ignores it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Objection:
Art as an
arbitrary
product not
subject to
law.</em></div>

<p>To some, I know, it appears that literature is a sphere in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>which the strict sense of the word 'law' has no application:
that such laws belong to nature, not to art. The essence, it
is contended, of the natural sciences is the certainty of the
facts with which they deal. Art, on the contrary, is creative;
it does not come into the category of objective phenomena at
all, but is the product of some artist's will, and therefore
purely arbitrary. If in a compilation of observations in
natural history for scientific use it became known that the
compiler had at times drawn upon his imagination for his
details, the whole compilation would become useless; and any
scientific theories based upon it would be discredited. But
the artist bases his work wholly on imagination, and caprice
is a leading art-beauty: how, it is asked, can so arbitrary a
subject-matter be reduced to the form of positive laws?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Third
axiom of
inductive
criticism:
art a part
of nature.</em></div>

<p>In view of any such objections, it may be well to set up
a third axiom of inductive criticism: <em>That art is a part of
nature</em>. Nature, it is true, is the vaguest of words: but this
is a vagueness common to the objection and the answer. The
objection rests really on a false antithesis, of which one term
is 'nature,' while it is not clear what is the other term; the
axiom set up in answer implies that there is no real distinction
between 'nature' and the other phenomena which are the
subject of human enquiry. The distinction is supposed to
rest upon the degree to which arbitrary elements of the
mind, such as imagination, will, caprice, enter into such
a thing as art-production. <span class="sidenote"><em>Other arbitrary
products
subject
to
inductive
treatment.</em></span>But there are other things in
which the human will plays as much part as it does in art,
and which have nevertheless proved compatible with inductive
treatment. Those who hold that 'thought is free' do not
reject psychology as an inductive science; actual politics are
made up of struggles of will, exercises of arbitrary power, and
the like, and yet there is a political science. If there is an
inductive science of politics, men's voluntary actions in the
pursuit of public life, and an inductive science of economy,
men's voluntary actions in pursuit of wealth, why should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>there not be an inductive science of art, men's voluntary
actions in pursuit of the beautiful? The whole of human
action, as well as the whole of external nature, comes within
the jurisdiction of science; so far from the productions of
the will and imagination being exempted from scientific
treatment, will and imagination themselves form chapters in
psychology, and caprice has been analysed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">III.
<em>Testing by
fixed
standards
inconsistent
with
inductive
treatment.</em></div>

<p>It remains to notice the third of the three ideas in relation
to which the two kinds of criticism are in complete contrast
with one another. It is a vague notion, which no objector
would formulate, but which as a fact does underlie judicial
criticism, and insensibly accompanies its testing and assaying.
It is the idea that the foundations of literary form have
reached their final settlement, the past being tacitly taken as
a standard for the present and future, or the present as a
standard for the past. Thus in the treatment of new literature
the idea manifests itself in a secret antagonism to
variations from received models; at the very least, new forms
are called upon to justify themselves, and so the judicial
critic brings his least receptive attitude to the new effects
which need receptiveness most. In opposition to this tacit
assumption, inductive criticism starts with a distinct counter-axiom
of the utmost importance: <em>That literature is a thing of
development</em>. <span class="sidenote"><em>Fourth
axiom of
inductive
criticism:
literature
a thing of
development.</em></span>This axiom implies that the critic must come to
literature as to that in which he is expecting to find unlimited
change and variety; he must keep before him the fact that
production must always be far ahead of criticism and
analysis, and must have carried its conquering invention into
fresh regions before science, like settled government in the
wake of the pioneer, follows to explain the new effects by
new principles. No doubt in name literary development is
recognised in all criticism; yet in its treatment both of old
literature and new the <em>à priori</em> criticism is false to development
in the scientific sense of the term. <span class="sidenote"><em>Ignoring
of development
in
new literature:</em></span>Such systems are apt to
begin by laying down that 'the object of literature is so and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>so,' or that 'the purpose of the Drama is to pourtray human
nature'; they then proceed to test actual literature and
dramas by the degree in which they carry out these fundamental
principles. Such procedure is the opposite of the
inductive method, and is a practical denial of development in
literature. <span class="sidenote"><em>'purpose'
in literature
continually
modifying.</em></span>Assuming that the object of existing literature
were correctly described, such a formula could not bind the
literature of the future. Assuming that there was ever a
branch of art which could be reduced to one simple purpose,
yet the inherent tendency of the human mind and its productions
to develop would bring it about that what were at first
means towards this purpose would in time become ends in
themselves side by side with the main purpose, giving us in
addition to the simple species a modified variety of it; external
influences, again, would mingle with the native characteristics
of the original species, and produce new species
compound in their purposes and effects. The real literature
would be ever obeying the first principle of development
and changing from simple to complex, while the criticism that
tried it by the original standard would be at each step
removed one degree further from the only standard by which
the literature could be explained. <span class="sidenote"><em>Development
in
past literature
confused
with
improvement.</em></span>And if judicial criticism
fails in providing for development in the future and present,
it is equally unfortunate in giving a false twist to development
when looked for in the past. The critic of comparative
standards is apt to treat early stages of literature as elementary,
tacitly assuming his own age as a standard <em>up to</em>
which previous periods have developed. Thus his treatment
of the past becomes often an assessment of the degrees in
which past periods have approximated to his own, advancing
from literary pot-hooks to his own running facility. The
clearness of an ancient writer he values at fifty per cent. as
compared with modern standards, his concatenation of
sentences is put down as only forty-five. But what if a
certain degree of mistiness be an essential element in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>phase of literary development to which the particular writer
belongs, so that in him modern clearness would become, in
judicial phrase, a fault? What if Plato's concatenation of
sentences would simply spoil the flavour of Herodotus's story-telling,
if Jeremy Taylor's prolixity and Milton's bi-lingual
prose be simply the fittest of all dresses for the thought of
their age and individual genius? In fact, the critic of fixed
standards confuses development with <em>improvement</em>: a parallel
mistake in natural history would be to understand the statement
that man is higher in the scale of development than
the butterfly as implying that a butterfly was God's failure
in the attempt to make man. The inductive critic will
accord to the early forms of his art the same independence he
accords to later forms. Development will not mean to him
education for a future stage, but the perpetual branching out
of literary activity into ever fresh varieties, different in kind
from one another, and each to be studied by standards of its
own: the 'individuality' of authors is the expression in
literary parlance which corresponds to the perpetual 'differentiation'
of new species in science. Alike, then, in his
attitude to the past and the future, the inductive critic will
eschew the temptation to judgment by fixed standards, which
in reality means opposing lifeless rules to the ever-living
variety of nature. He will leave a dead judicial criticism to
bury its dead authors and to pen for them judicious epitaphs,
and will himself approach literature filled equally with reverence
for the unbroken vitality of its past and faith in its
exhaustless future.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Summary.</em></div>

<p>To gather up our results. Induction, as the most universal
of scientific methods, may be presumed to apply
wherever there is a subject-matter reducible to the form of
fact; such a subject-matter will be found in literature where
its effects are interpreted, not arbitrarily, but with strict reference
to the details of the literary works as they actually
stand. There is thus an inductive literary criticism, akin in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>spirit and methods to the other inductive sciences, and distinct
from other branches of criticism, such as the criticism
of taste. This inductive criticism will entirely free itself
from the judicial spirit and its comparisons of merit, which
is found to have been leading criticism during half its history
on to false tracks from which it has taken the other half
to retrace its steps. On the contrary, inductive criticism
will examine literature in the spirit of pure investigation:
looking for the laws of art in the practice of artists, and
treating art, like the rest of nature, as a thing of continuous
development, which may thus be expected to fall, with each
author and school, into varieties distinct in kind from one
another, and each of which can be fully grasped only when
examined with an attitude of mind adapted to the special
variety without interference from without.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To illustrate the criticism thus described in its application
to Shakespeare is the purpose of the present work.</p>

<p>The scope of the book is limited to the consideration of
Shakespeare in his character as the great master of the
Romantic Drama; and its treatment of his dramatic art
divides itself into two parts. The first applies the inductive
method in a series of Studies devoted to particular plays,
and to single important features of dramatic art which these
plays illustrate. One of the purposes of this first part is to
bring out how the inductive method, besides its scientific interest,
has the further recommendation of assisting more
than any other treatment to enlarge our appreciation of the
author and of his achievements. The second part will use the
materials collected in the first part to present, in the form of a
brief survey, Dramatic Criticism as an inductive science:
enumerating, so far as its materials admit, the leading topics
which such a science would treat, and arranging these topics
in the logical connection which scientific method requires.</p>

<p class="hang right"><em>A Study in the Raw Material of
the Romantic Drama</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Story as
the Raw
Materials
of the Romantic
Drama.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">THE starting-point in the treatment of any work of literature
is its position in literary history: the recognition
of this gives the attitude of mind which is most favourable for
extracting from the work its full effect. The division of the
universal Drama to which Shakespeare belongs is known as
the 'Romantic Drama,' one of its chief distinctions being
that it uses the stories of Romance, together with histories
treated as story-books, as the sources from which the matter
of the plays is taken; Romances are the <em>raw material</em> out of
which the Shakespearean Drama is manufactured. This very
fact serves to illustrate the elevation of the Elizabethan
Drama in the scale of literary development: just as the
weaver uses as his raw material that which is the finished
product of the spinner, so Shakespeare and his contemporaries
start in their art of dramatising from Story which is
already a form of art. In the exhibition, then, of Shakespeare
as an Artist, it is natural to begin with the raw
material which he worked up into finished masterpieces.
For illustration of this no play could be more suitable than
<em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, in which two tales, already familiar
in the story form, have been woven together into a single
plot: the Story of the Cruel Jew, who entered into a bond
with his enemy of which the forfeit was to be a pound of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>enemy's own flesh, and the Story of the Heiress and the
Caskets. The present study will deal with the stories themselves,
considering them as if with the eye of a dramatic
artist to catch the points in which they lend themselves to
dramatic effect; the next will show how Shakespeare improves
the stories in the telling, increasing their dramatic
force by the very process of working them up; a third study
will point out how, not content with two stories, he has
added others in the development of his plot, making it more
complex only in reality to make it more simple.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Story of
The Jew.</em></div>

<p>In the Story of the Jew the main point is its special capability
for bringing out the idea of <em>Nemesis</em>, one of the
simplest and most universal of dramatic motives. Described
broadly, Nemesis is retribution as it appears in the world of
art. <span class="sidenote"><em>Nemesis as
a dramatic
idea.</em></span>In reality the term covers two distinct conceptions: in
ancient thought Nemesis was an artistic bond between excess
and reaction, in modern thought it is an artistic bond
between sin and retribution. The distinction is part of the
general difference between Greek and modern views of life.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Ancient
conception:
artistic
connection
between
excess and
reaction.</em></span>The Greeks may be said to be the most artistic nation of
mankind, in the sense that art covered so large a proportion
of their whole personality: it is not surprising to find that
they projected their sense of art into morals. Aristotle was
a moral philosopher, but his system of ethics reads as an
artistically devised pattern, in which every virtue is removed
at equal distances from vices of excess and defect balancing
it on opposite sides. The Greek word for law signifies proportion
and distribution, <em>nomos</em>; and it is only another form
of it that expresses <em>Nemesis</em> as the power punishing violations
of proportion in things human. Distinct from Justice,
which was occupied with crime, Nemesis was a companion
deity to Fortune; and as Fortune went through the world
distributing the good things of life heedlessly without regard
to merit, so Nemesis followed in her steps, and,
equally without regard to merit, delighted in cutting down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>prosperity that was high enough to attract her attention. Polycrates
is the typical victim of such Nemesis: cast off by his
firmest ally for no offence but an unbroken career of good
luck, in the reaction from which his ally feared to be involved;
essaying as a forlorn hope to propitiate by voluntarily
throwing in the sea his richest crown-jewel; recognising
when this was restored by fishermen that heaven had refused
his sacrifice, and abandoning himself to his fate in despair.
But Nemesis, to the moral sense of antiquity, could go even
beyond visitation on innocent prosperity, and goodness itself
could be carried to a degree that invited divine reaction.
Heroes like Lycurgus and Pentheus perished for excess of
temperance; and the ancient Drama startles the modern
reader with an Hippolytus, whose passionate purity brought
down on him a destruction prophesied beforehand by those
to whom religious duty suggested moderate indulgence in
lust.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Modern
conception:
artistic
connection
between sin
and retribution.</em></div>

<p>Such malignant correction of human inequalities is not
a function to harmonise with modern conceptions of Deity.
Yet the Greek notion of Nemesis has an element of permanency
in it, for it represents a principle underlying human
life. It suggests a sort of elasticity in human experience, a
tendency to rebound from a strain; this is the equilibrium of
the moral world, the force which resists departure from the
normal, becoming greater in proportion as departure from
the normal is wider. Thus in commercial speculation there
is a safe medium certain to bring profit in the long run; in
social ambition there is a certain rise though slow: if a man
hurries to be rich, or seeks to rise in public life by leaps and
bounds, the spectator becomes aware of a secret force that
has been set in motion, as when the equilibrium of physical
bodies has been disturbed, which force threatens to drag the
aspirant down to the point from which he started, or to
debase him lower in proportion to the height at which he
rashly aimed. Such a force is 'risk,' and it may remain risk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>but if it be crowned with the expected fall the whole is
recognised as 'Nemesis.' This Nemesis is deeply embedded
in the popular mind and repeatedly crops up in its proverbial
wisdom. Proverbs like 'Grasp all, lose all,' 'When
things come to the worst they are sure to mend,' exactly
express moral equilibrium, and the 'golden mean' is its
proverbial formula. The saying 'too much of a good thing'
suggests that the Nemesis on departures from the golden
mean applies to good things as well as bad; while the
principle is made to apply even to the observation of the
golden mean itself in the proverb 'Nothing venture, nothing
have.' Nevertheless, this side of the whole notion has in
modern usage fallen into the background in comparison
with another aspect of Nemesis. The grand distinction of
modern thought is the predominance in it of moral ideas:
they colour even its imagination; and if the Greeks carried
their art-sense into morals, modern instincts have carried
morals into art. In particular the speculations raised by
Christianity have cast the shadow of Sin over the whole
universe. It has been said that the conception of Sin is
unknown to the ancients, and that the word has no real
equivalent in Latin or Classical Greek. The modern mind
is haunted by it. Notions of Sin have invaded art, and
Nemesis shows their influence: vague conceptions of some
supernatural vindication of artistic proportion in life have
now crystallised into the interest of watching morals and
art united in their treatment of Sin. The link between Sin
and its retribution becomes a form of art-pleasure; and no
dramatic effect is more potent in modern Drama than that
which emphasises the principle that whatsoever a man soweth
that shall he also reap.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Dramatic
Nemesis
latent in
the Story
of the Jew.</em></div>

<p>Now for this dramatic effect of Nemesis it would be
difficult to find a story promising more scope than the Story
of the Cruel Jew. It will be seen at once to contain a
double nemesis, attaching to the Jew himself and to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>victim. The two moreover represent the different conceptions
of Nemesis in the ancient and modern world; Antonio's
excess of moral confidence suffers a nemesis of reaction in
his humiliation, and Shylock's sin of judicial murder finds a
nemesis of retribution in his ruin by process of law. The
nemesis, it will be observed, is not merely two-fold, but
double in the way that a double flower is distinct from two
flowers: it is a nemesis <em>on</em> a nemesis; the nemesis which
visits Antonio's fault is the crime for which Shylock suffers
his nemesis. Again, in that which gives artistic character
to the reaction and the retribution the two nemeses differ.
Let St. Paul put the difference for us: 'Some men's sins
are evident, going before unto judgment; and some they
follow after.' So in cases like that of Shylock the nemesis
is interesting from its very obviousness and the impatience
with which we look for it; in the case of Antonio the
nemesis is striking for the very opposite reason, that he of
all men seemed most secure against it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Antonio:
perfection
and self-sufficiency,
the Nemesis
of Surprise.</em></div>

<p>Antonio must be understood as a perfect character: for
we must read the play in the light of its age, and intolerance
was a mediæval virtue. But there is no single good quality
that does not carry with it its special temptation, and the
sum of them all, or perfection, has its shadow in self-sufficiency.
It is so with Antonio. Of all national types
of character the Roman is the most self-sufficient, alike
incorruptible by temptation and independent of the softer
influences of life:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 297.</span>we find that 'Roman honour' is the
idea which Antonio's friends are accustomed to associate
with him. Further the dramatist contrives to exhibit Antonio
to us in circumstances calculated to bring out this drawback
to his perfection. In the opening scene we see the
dignified merchant-prince suffering under the infliction of
frivolous visitors, to which his friendship with the young
nobleman exposes him: his tone throughout the interview is
that of the barest toleration, and suggests that his courtesies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>are felt rather as what is due to himself than what is due
to those on whom they are bestowed.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 60-64.</span>When Salarino makes
flattering excuses for taking his leave, Antonio replies, first
with conventional compliment,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Your worth is very dear in my regard,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>and then with blunt plainness, as if Salarino were not worth
the trouble of keeping up polite fiction:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I take it, your own business calls on you</div>
<div class="i0">And you embrace the occasion to depart.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 8.</div>
<p>The visitors, trying to find explanation for Antonio's seriousness,
suggest that he is thinking of his vast commercial
speculations; Antonio draws himself up:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 41.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</div>
<div class="i0">My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</div>
<div class="i0">Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</div>
<div class="i0">Upon the fortune of this present year:</div>
<div class="i0">Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Antonio is saying in his prosperity that <em>he</em> shall never be
moved. But the great temptation to self-sufficiency lies in
his contact, not with social inferiors, but with a moral outcast
such as Shylock: confident that the moral gulf between
the two can never be bridged over, Antonio has violated
dignity as well as mercy in the gross insults he has heaped
upon the Jew whenever they have met.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 99 &amp;c.</span>In the Bond Scene
we see him unable to restrain his insults at the very moment
in which he is soliciting a favour from his enemy;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 107-130.</span>the effect
reaches a climax as Shylock gathers up the situation in a
single speech, reviewing the insults and taunting his oppressor
with the solicited obligation:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Well then, it now appears you need my help:</div>
<div class="i0">Go to, then; you come to me, and you say,</div>
<div class="i0">'Shylock, we would have moneys': you say so;</div>
<div class="i0">You, that did void your rheum upon my beard</div>
<div class="i0">And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</div>
<div class="i0">Over your threshold: moneys is your suit.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>There is such a foundation of justice for these taunts that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>for a moment our sympathies are transferred to Shylock's
side. But Antonio, so far from taking warning, is betrayed
beyond all bounds in his defiance; and in the challenge
to fate with which he replies we catch the tone of infatuated
confidence, the <em>hybris</em> in which Greek superstition saw the
signal for the descent of Nemesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 131.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I am as like to call thee so again,</div>
<div class="i0">To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.</div>
<div class="i0">If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</div>
<div class="i0">As to thy friends ...</div>
<div class="i0"><em>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</em></div>
<div class="i0"><em>Who, if he break, thou may'st with better face</em></div>
<div class="i0"><em>Exact the penalty</em>.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>To this challenge of self-sufficiency the sequel of the story
is the answering Nemesis: the merchant becomes a bankrupt,
the first citizen of Venice a prisoner at the bar, the
morally perfect man holds his life and his all at the mercy of
the reprobate he thought he might safely insult.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Shylock:
malignant
justice, the
Nemesis of
Measure

Measure.</em></div>

<p>So Nemesis has surprised Antonio in spite of his perfectness:
but the malice of Shylock is such as is perpetually
crying for retribution, and the retribution is delayed only
that it may descend with accumulated force. In the case of
this second nemesis the Story of the Jew exhibits dramatic
capability in the opportunity it affords for the sin and the
retribution to be included within the same scene.

happy thought is a turning-point in the Trial Scene on the
two sides of which we have the Jew's triumph and the Jew's
retribution; the two sides are bound together by the principle
of measure for measure, and for each detail of vindictiveness
that is developed in the first half of the scene there
is a corresponding item of nemesis in the sequel.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Charter</em> v.
<em>statute</em>.
<strong>iv.</strong> i. 38;
compare
102, 219.</span>To begin
with, Shylock appeals to the charter of the city. It is one of
the distinctions between written and unwritten law that no
flagrant injustice can arise out of the latter. If the analogy of
former precedents would seem to threaten such an
injustice, it is easy in a new case to meet the special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>emergency by establishing a new precedent; where, however,
the letter of the written law involves a wrong, however great,
it must, nevertheless, be exactly enforced. Shylock takes
his stand upon written law; <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>iii.</strong> iii. 26-31.</span>indeed upon the strictest of all
kinds of written law, for the charter of the city would seem
to be the instrument regulating the relations between citizens
and aliens&mdash;an absolute necessity for a free port&mdash;which
could not be superseded without international negotiations.
But what is the result? As plaintiff in the cause Shylock
would, in the natural course of justice, leave the court, when
judgment had been given against him, with no further
mortification than the loss of his suit. He is about to do so
when he is recalled:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">It is enacted in the laws of Venice, &amp;c.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 314.</div>

<p>Unwittingly, he has, by the action he has taken, entangled
himself with an old statute law, forgotten by all except the
learned Bellario, which, going far beyond natural law, made
the mere attempt upon a citizen's life by an alien punishable
to the same extent as murder. Shylock had chosen the
letter of the law, and by the letter of the law he is to suffer.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Humour</em> v.
<em>quibble</em>.</span>Again, every one must feel that the plea on which Portia
upsets the bond is in reality the merest quibble. It is appropriate
enough in the mouth of a bright girl playing the
lawyer, but no court of justice could seriously entertain it for
a moment: by every principle of interpretation a bond that
could justify the cutting of human flesh must also justify the
shedding of blood, which is necessarily implied in such
cutting. But, to balance this, we have Shylock in the earlier
part of the scene refusing to listen to arguments of justice,
and taking his stand upon his 'humour':
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 40-62.</span>if he has a whim,
he pleads, for giving ten thousand ducats to have a rat
poisoned, who shall prevent him? The suitor who rests his
cause on a whim cannot complain if it is upset by a quibble.
Similarly, throughout the scene, every point in Shylock's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>justice of malice meets its answer in the justice of nemesis.
He is offered double the amount of his loan:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Offer of
double</em> v.
<em>refusal of
principal.</em></div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If every ducat in six thousand ducats</div>
<div class="i0">Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>he answers, he would not accept them in lieu of his bond.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 318,
336.</span>The wheel of Nemesis goes round, and Shylock would
gladly accept not only this offer but even the bare principal;
but he is denied, on the ground that he has refused it in open
court. They try to bend him to thoughts of mercy:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Complete
security</em> v.
<em>total loss.</em></div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He dares to reply:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What judgement shall I dread, doing no wrong?</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The wheel of Nemesis goes round, and Shylock's life and all
lie at the mercy of the victim to whom he had refused mercy
and the judge to whose appeal for mercy he would not
listen. <span class="sidenote"><em>Exultation</em>
v. <em>irony.</em></span>In the flow of his success, when every point is
being given in his favour, he breaks out into unseemly
exultation:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 223,
246, 250,
301, 304.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A Daniel come to judgement! yea, a Daniel!</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The ebb comes, and his enemies catch up the cry and turn
it against him:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 313,
317, 323,
333, 340.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!</div>
<div class="i0">I thank thee, Jew, for <em>teaching</em> me that word.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such then is the Story of the Jew, and so it exhibits
nemesis clashing with nemesis, the nemesis of surprise with
the nemesis of equality and intense satisfaction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Caskets
Story.</em></div>

<p>In the Caskets Story, which Shakespeare has associated
with the Story of the Jew, the dramatic capabilities are of a
totally different kind. In the artist's armoury one of the
most effective weapons is Idealisation:
<span class="sidenote"><em>Idealisation:</em></span>inexplicable touches
throwing an attractiveness over the repulsive, uncovering
the truth and beauty which lie hidden in the commonplace,
and showing how much can be brought out of how little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>with how little change.
<span class="sidenote"><em>the exhibition
of a
commonplace
experience
in
a glorified
form.</em></span>A story will be excellent material,
then, for dramatic handling which contains at once some
experience of ordinary life, and also the surroundings which
can be made to exhibit this experience in a glorified form:
the more commonplace the experience, the greater the
triumph of art if it can be idealised. The point of the
Caskets Story to the eye of an artist in Drama is the opportunity
it affords for such an idealisation of the commonest
problem in everyday experience&mdash;what may be called the
Problem of Judgment by Appearances.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Problem of
Judgment
by Appearances.</em></div>

<p>In the choice between alternatives there are three ways in
which judgment may be exercised. The first mode, if it can be
called judgment at all, is to accept the decision of chance&mdash;to
cast lots, or merely to drift into a decision. An opposite to
this is purely rational choice. But rational choice, if strictly
interpreted as a logical process, involves great complications.
If a man would choose according to the methods of strict
reason, he must, first of all, purge himself of all passion, for
passion and reason are antagonistic. Next, he must examine
himself as to the possibility of latent prejudice; and as
prejudice may be unconsciously inherited, he must include in
the sphere of his examination ancestral and national bias.
Then, he must accumulate all the evidence that can possibly
bear upon the question in hand, and foresee every eventuality
that can result from either alternative. When he has all the
materials of choice before him, he must proceed to balance
them against one another, seeing first that the mental
faculties employed in the process have been equally developed
by training. All such preliminary conditions having
been satisfied, he may venture to enquire on which side the
balance dips, maintaining his suspense so long as the dip
is undecided. And when a man has done all this he has
attained only that degree of approach to strictly rational
choice which his imperfect nature admits. Such pure
reason has no place in real life: judgment in practical affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>is something between chance and this strict reason; it
attempts to use the machinery of rational choice, but only so
far as practical considerations proper to the matter in hand
allow. This medium choice is what I am here calling Judgment
by Appearances, for it is clear that the antithesis
between appearance and reality will obtain so long as the
materials of choice are scientifically incomplete; the term
will apply with more and more appropriateness as the
divergence from perfect conditions of choice is greater.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>This idealised:
a
maximum
in the issue.</em></div>

<p>Judgment by Appearances so defined is the only method
of judgment proper to practical life, and accordingly an
exalted exhibition of it must furnish a keen dramatic interest.
How is such a process to be glorified? Clearly Judgment by
Appearances will reach the ideal stage when there is the
maximum of importance in the issue to be decided and the
minimum of evidence by which to decide it. These two
conditions are satisfied in the Caskets Story. In questions
touching the individual life, that of marriage has this unique
importance, that it is bound up with wide consequences which
extend beyond the individual himself to his posterity. With
the suitors of Portia the question is of marriage with the
woman who is presented as supreme of her age in beauty, in
wealth and in character; <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 40,
&amp;c.</span>moreover, the other alternative is
a vow of perpetual celibacy. So the question at issue in the
Caskets Story concerns the most important act of life in the
most important form in which it can be imagined to present
itself. <span class="sidenote"><em>and a
minimum
in the evidence.</em></span>When we turn to the evidence on which this question
is to be decided we find that of rational evidence there is absolutely
none. The choice is to be made between three
caskets distinguished by their metals and by the accompanying
inscriptions:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> vii. 5-9.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.</div>
<div class="i0">Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.</div>
<div class="i0">Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>However individual fancies may incline, it is manifestly impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>to set up any train of <em>reasoning</em> which should
discover a ground of preference amongst the three. And it
is worth noting, as an example of Shakespeare's nicety in
detail, that the successful chooser reads in the scroll which
announces his victory,</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<strong>iii.</strong> ii. 132.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">You that choose not by the view,</div>
<div class="i0">Chance <em>as</em> fair, and choose <em>as</em> true:</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shakespeare does not say '<em>more</em> fair,' '<em>more</em> true.'
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 30-36.</span>This
equal balancing of the alternatives will appear still clearer
when we recollect that it is an intentional puzzle with which
we are dealing, and accordingly that even if ingenuity could
discover a preponderance of reason in favour of any one of
the three, there would be the chance that this preponderance
had been anticipated by the father who set the puzzle. The
case becomes like that of children bidden to guess in which
hand a sweetmeat is concealed. They are inclined to say the
right hand, but hesitate whether that answer may not have
been foreseen and the sweetmeat put in the left hand; and if
on this ground they are tempted to be sharp and guess the
left hand, there is the possibility that this sharpness may have
been anticipated, and the sweetmeat kept after all in the
right hand. If then the Caskets Story places before us three
suitors, going through three trains of intricate reasoning for
guidance in a matter on which their whole future depends,
whereas we, the spectators, can see that from the nature of
the case no reasoning can possibly avail them, we have
clearly the Problem of Judgment by Appearances drawn out
in its ideal form; and our sympathies are attracted by the
sight of a process, belonging to our everyday experience,
yet developed before us in all the force artistic setting
can bestow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Solution of
the problem:
the characters of the choosers
determine
their fates.</em></div>

<p>But is this all? Does Shakespeare display before us the
problem, yet give no help towards its solution? The key to
the suitors' fates is not to be found in the trains of reasoning
they go through.
As if to warn us against looking for it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>this direction. Shakespeare contrives that we never hear the
reasonings of the successful suitor. By a natural touch
Portia, who has chosen Bassanio in her heart, is represented
as unable to bear the suspense of hearing him
deliberate, and calls for music to drown his meditations; <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
43; esp. 61.</span>it is
only the conclusion to which he has come that we catch as
the music closes. The particular song selected on this
occasion points dimly in the direction in which we are to
look for the true solution of the problem:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 63.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Tell me where is fancy bred,</div>
<div class="i0">Or in the heart or in the head?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>'Fancy' in Shakespearean English means 'love'; and the
discussion, whether love belongs to the head or the heart, is
no inappropriate accompaniment to a reality which consists
in this&mdash;that the success in love of the suitors, which they
are seeking to compass by their reasonings, is in fact being
decided by their characters.</p>

<p>To compare the characters of the three suitors, it will be
enough to note the different form that pride takes in each.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, vii.</span>The first suitor is a prince of a barbarian race, who has
thus never known equals, but has been taught to consider
himself half divine; as if made of different clay from the rest
of mankind he instinctively shrinks from 'lead.'
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> vii. 20.</span>Yet modesty
mingles with his pride, and though he feels truly that, so far
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> vii. 24-30.</span>as the estimation of him by others is concerned, he might
rely upon 'desert,' yet he doubts if desert extends as far as
Portia. <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> vii, from
36.</span>What seizes his attention is the words, 'what many
men desire'; and he rises to a flight of eloquence in picturing
wildernesses and deserts become thoroughfares by the
multitude of suitors flocking to Belmont. But he is all the
while betraying a secret of which he was himself unconscious:
he has been led to seek the hand of Portia, not
by true love, but by the feeling that what all the world is
seeking the Prince of Morocco must not be slow to claim.
Very different is the pride of Arragon.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ix.</span>He has no regal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>position, but rather appears to be one who has fallen in
social rank: <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>ii.</strong> ix. 47-9.</span>he makes up for such a fall by intense pride of
family, and is one of those who complacently thank heaven
that they are not as other men. The 'many men' which
had attracted Morocco repels Arragon:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ix. 31.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I will not choose what many men desire,</div>
<div class="i0">Because I will not jump with common spirits,</div>
<div class="i0">And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ix, from
36.</div>
<p>
He is caught by the bait of 'desert.' It is true he almost
deceives us with the lofty tone in which he reflects how the
world would benefit if dignities and offices were in all cases
purchased by the merit of the wearer; yet there peeps
through his sententiousness his real conception of merit&mdash;the
sole merit of family descent. His ideal is that the 'true seed
of honour' should be 'picked from the chaff and ruin of the
times,' and wrest greatness from the 'low peasantry' who
had risen to it. He accordingly rests his fate upon desert:
and he finds in the casket of his choice a fool's head.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
73.</span>Of Bassanio's soliloquy we hear enough to catch that his pride
is the pride of the soldier, who will yield to none the post of
danger, <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> ii. 124.</span>and how he is thus attracted by the 'threatening' of
the leaden casket:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i9">thou meagre lead,</div>
<div class="i0">Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,</div>
<div class="i0">Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Moreover, he is a lover, and the threatening is a challenge
to show what he will risk for love: his true heart finds its
natural satisfaction in 'giving and hazarding' his all. This
is the pride that is worthy of Portia; and thus the ingenious
puzzle of the 'inspired' father has succeeded in piercing
through the outer defence of specious reasoning, and carrying
its repulsion and attraction to the inmost characters
of the suitors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>General
principle:
character
as an element
in
judgment.</em></div>

<p>Such, then, is Shakespeare's treatment of the Problem of
Judgment by Appearances: while he draws out the problem
itself to its fullest extent in displaying the suitors elaborating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>trains of argument for a momentous decision in which we
see that reason can be of no avail, he suggests for the
solution that, besides reason, there is in such judgments
another element, character, and that in those crises in which
reason is most fettered, character is most potent. An important
solution this is; for what is character? A man's
character is the shadow of his past life; it is the grand
resultant of all the forces from within and from without that
have been operating upon him since he became a conscious
agent. Character is the sandy footprint of the commonplace
hardened into the stone of habit; it is the complexity
of daily tempers, judgments, restraints, impulses, all focussed
into one master-passion acting with the rapidity of an
instinct. To lay down then, that where reason fails as an
element in judgment, character comes to its aid, is to bind
together the exceptional and the ordinary in life. In most of
the affairs of life men have scope for the exercise of
commonplace qualities, but emergencies do come where
this is denied them; in these cases, while they think, like
the three suitors, that they are moving voluntarily in the
direction in which they are judging fit at the moment, in
reality the weight of their past lives is forcing them in the
direction in which their judgment has been accustomed
to take them. Thus in the moral, as in the physical world,
nothing is ever lost: not a ripple on the surface of conduct
but goes on widening to the outermost limit of experience.
Shakespeare's contribution to the question of practical
judgment is that by the long exercise of commonplace
qualities we are building up a character which, though
unconsciously, is the determining force in the emergencies
in which commonplace qualities are impossible.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">How Shakespeare Improves the stories
in the Telling.</span></p>

<p class="right"><em>A Study in Dramatic Workmanship.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Two points of Dramatic Mechanism.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">IN treating the Story as the raw material of the Romantic
Drama it has already been shown, in the case of the
stories utilised for <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, what natural capacities
these exhibit for dramatic effect. The next step is to
show how the artist increases their dramatic force in the process
of working them up. Two points will be illustrated in
the present study: first, how Shakespeare meets the difficulties
of a story and reduces them to a minimum; secondly,
how he improves the two tales by weaving them together so
that they assist one another's effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Reduction of difficulties specially important in Drama.</em></div>

<p>The avoidance or reduction of difficulties in a story is an
obvious element in any kind of artistic handling; it is of
special importance in Drama in proportion as we are more
sensitive to improbabilities in what is supposed to take
place before our eyes than in what we merely hear of by
narrative. This branch of art could not be better illustrated
than in the Story of the Jew: never perhaps has an artist had
to deal with materials so bristling with difficulties of the
greatest magnitude, and never, it may be added, have they
been met with greater ingenuity. The host of improbabilities
gathering about such a detail as the pound of flesh must
strike every mind. <span class="sidenote"><em>First difficulty:
monstrosity
of the Jew's character.</em></span>There is, however, preliminary to these,
another difficulty of more general application: the difficulty
of painting a character bad enough to be the hero of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>story. It might be thought that to paint excess of badness
is comparatively easy, as needing but a coarse brush. On the
contrary, there are few severer tests of creative power than
the treatment of monstrosity. To be told that there is
villainy in the world and tacitly to accept the statement may
be easy; it is another thing to be brought into close contact
with the villains, to hear them converse, to watch their actions
and occasionally to be taken into their confidence. We realise
in Drama through our sympathy and our experience: in real
life we have not been accustomed to come across monsters
and are unfamiliar with their behaviour; in proportion then
as the badness of a character is exaggerated it is carried outside
the sphere of our experience, the naturalness of the
scene is interrupted and its human interest tends to decline.
So, in the case of the story under consideration, the dramatist
is confronted with this dilemma: he must make the character
of Shylock absolutely bad, or the incident of the bond will
appear unreal; he must not make the character extraordinarily
bad, or there is danger of the whole scene appearing
unreal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Its repulsiveness counteracted by sympathy with his wrongs.</em></div>

<p>Shakespeare meets a difficulty of this kind by a double
treatment. On the one hand, he puts no limits to the
blackness of the character itself; on the other hand, he
provides against repulsiveness by giving it a special attraction
of another kind. In the present case, while painting Shylock
as a monster, he secures for him a hold upon our sympathy
by representing him as a victim of intolerable ill-treatment
and injustice. The effect resembles the popular sympathy
with criminals. The men themselves and their crimes are
highly repulsive; but if some slight irregularity occurs in the
process of bringing them to justice&mdash;if a counsel shows
himself unduly eager, or a judge appears for a moment one-sided,
a host of volunteer advocates espouse their cause.
These are actuated no doubt by sensitiveness to purity of
justice; but their protests have a ring that closely resembles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>sympathy with the criminals themselves, whom they not
unfrequently end by believing to be innocent and injured.
<span class="sidenote">e.g. in <strong>iii.</strong>
i, iii; <strong>iv.</strong>
i; <strong>ii.</strong> 5.</span>In the same way Shakespeare shows no moderation
in the touches of bloodthirstiness, of brutality, of sordid
meanness he heaps together in the character of Shylock;
but he takes equal pains to rouse our indignation at the
treatment he is made to suffer.
<span class="sidenote">e.g. <strong>iii.</strong> i.;
<strong>iv.</strong> i, &amp;c.</span>Personages such as Gratiano,
Salanio, Salarino, Tubal, serve to keep before us the mediæval
feud between Jew and Gentile, and the persecuting
insolence with which the fashionable youth met the money-lenders
who ministered to their necessities.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 107-138.</span>Antonio
himself has stepped out of his natural character in the
grossness of his insults to his enemy.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 57,
133;
<strong>iii.</strong> iii. 22;
and <strong>i.</strong> iii.
45.</span>Shylock has been
injured in pocket as well as in sentiment, Antonio using his
wealth to disturb the money-market and defeat the schemes
of the Jew; according to Shylock Antonio has hindered
him of half-a-million, and were he out of Venice the usurer
could make what merchandise he would. Finally, our sense
of deliverance in the Trial Scene cannot hinder a touch
of compunction for the crushed plaintiff, as he appeals
against the hard justice meted out to him:&mdash;the loss of his
property, the acceptance of his life as an act of grace, the
abandonment of his religion and race, which implies the
abandonment of the profession by which he makes his living.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 374.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:</div>
<div class="i0">You take my house when you do take the prop</div>
<div class="i0">That doth sustain my house; you take my life</div>
<div class="i0">When you do take the means whereby I live.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By thus making us resent the harsh fate dealt to Shylock the
dramatist recovers in our minds the fellow-feeling we have
lost in contemplating the Jew himself. <span class="sidenote"><em>Dramatic
Hedging.</em></span>A name for such
double treatment might be 'Dramatic Hedging': as the better
covers a possible loss by a second bet on the opposite side,
so, when the necessities of a story involve the creation of a
monster, the dramatic artist 'hedges' against loss of attractiveness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>by finding for the character human interest in some
other direction. So successful has Shakespeare been in
the present instance that a respectable minority of readers
rise from the play partisans of Shylock.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Difficulties
connected
with the
pound of
flesh.</em></div>

<p>We pass on to the crop of difficulties besetting the pound
of flesh as a detail in the bond. That such a bond should be
proposed, that when proposed it should be accepted, that it
should be seriously entertained by a court of justice, that if
entertained at all it should be upset on so frivolous a pretext
as the omission of reference to the shedding of blood: these
form a series of impossible circumstances that any dramatist
might despair of presenting with even an approach to
naturalness. Yet if we follow the course of the story as
moulded by Shakespeare we shall find all these impossibilities
one after another evaded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Proposal of
the bond.</em></div>

<p>At the end of the first scene Antonio had bidden Bassanio
go forth and try what his credit could do in Venice.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 179.</span>Armed
with this blank commission Bassanio hurries into the city.
As a gay young nobleman he knows nothing of the commercial
world except the money-lenders; and now proceeds
to the best-known of them, apparently unaware of what any
gossip on the Rialto could have told him, the unfortunate
relations between this Shylock and his friend Antonio.
<span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> iii. 1-40.</span>At the opening of the Bond Scene we find Bassanio and Shylock
in conversation, Bassanio impatient and irritated to find that
the famous security he has to offer seems to make so little
impression on the usurer.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 41.</span>At this juncture Antonio himself
falls<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in with them, sees at a glance to what his rash friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>has committed him, but is too proud to draw back in sight
of his enemy. Already a minor difficulty is surmounted, as
to how Antonio comes to be in the position of asking an
obligation of Shylock. Antonio is as impatient as dignity
will permit to bring an awkward business to a conclusion.
Shylock, on the contrary, to whom the interview itself is a
triumph, in which his persecutor is appearing before him in
the position of a client, casts about to prolong the conversation
to as great a length as possible. Any topic would serve
his purpose; but what topic more natural than the question
at the root of the feud between the two, the question of lending
money on interest? It is here we reach the very heart
of our problem, how the first mention of the pound of flesh
is made without a shock of unreality sufficient to ruin the
whole scene. Had Shylock asked for a forfeiture of a
million per cent., or in any other way thrown into a commercial
form his purpose of ruining Antonio, the old feud
and the present opportunity would be explanation sufficient:
the real difficulty is the total incongruity between such an
idea as a pound of human flesh and commercial transactions
of any kind. <span class="sidenote"><em>The proposal
led
up to by the discourse
on interest.</em></span>This difficulty Shakespeare has met by one of
his greatest triumphs of mechanical ingenuity: his leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>up to the proposal of the bond by the discussion on interest.
The effect of this device a modern reader is in danger of
losing: <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii, from
69.</span>we are so familiar with the idea of interest at the
present day that we are apt to forget what the difficulty was
to the ancient and mediæval mind, which for so many generations
kept the practice of taking interest outside the pale
of social decency. This prejudice was one of the confusions
arising out of the use of a metal currency. The ancient
mind could understand how corn put into the ground would
by the agency of time alone produce twentyfold, thirtyfold,
or a hundredfold; they could understand how cattle left to
themselves would without human assistance increase from a
small to a large flock: but how could metal grow? how
could lifeless gold and silver increase and multiply like
animals and human beings? The Greek word for interest,
<em>tokos</em>, is the exact equivalent of the English word <em>breed</em>, and
the idea underlying the two was regularly connected with
that of interest in ancient discussions. The same idea is
present throughout the dispute between Antonio and Shylock.
Antonio indignantly asks:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 134.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">when did friendship take</div>
<div class="i0">A <em>breed</em> for <em>barren metal</em> of his friend?</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 72.</div>

<p>Shylock illustrates usury by citing the patriarch Jacob and his
clever trick in cattle-breeding; showing how, at a time when
cattle were the currency, the natural rate of increase might
be diverted to private advantage. Antonio interrupts him:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 96.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shylock answers:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I cannot tell; I make it <em>breed</em> as fast;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>both parties thus showing that they considered the distinction
between the using of flesh and metal for the medium of
wealth to be the essential point in their dispute. With this
notion then of flesh <em>versus</em> money floating in the air between
them the interview goes on to the outbursts of mutual hatred
which reach a climax in Antonio's challenge to Shylock to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>his worst;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii, from
138.</span>this challenge suddenly combines with the root
idea of the conversation to flash into Shylock's mind the suggestion
of the bond. In an instant he smoothes his face and
proposes friendship. He will lend the money without interest,
in pure kindness, nay more, he will go to that extent of good
understanding implied in joking, and will have a merry bond;
while as to the particular joke (he says in effect), since you
Christians cannot understand interest in the case of money
while you acknowledge it in the case of flesh and blood,
suppose I take as my interest in this bond a pound of your
own flesh. In such a context the monstrous proposal sounds
almost natural. It has further been ushered <span class="err" title="original: in in">in a</span> manner
which makes it almost impossible to decline it. When one
who is manifestly an injured man is the first to make advances,
a generous adversary finds it almost impossible to
hold back. A sensitive man, again, will shrink from nothing
more than from the ridicule attaching to those who take serious
precautions against a jest. And the more incongruous Shylock's
proposal is with commercial negotiations the better
evidence it is of his non-commercial intentions. In a word,
the essence of the difficulty was the incongruity between
human flesh and money transactions: it has been surmounted
by a discussion, flowing naturally from the position of the
two parties, of which the point is the relative position of
flesh and money as the medium of wealth in the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Difficulty
of legally
recognising
the bond
evaded:</em></div>

<p>The bond thus proposed and accepted, there follows the
difficulty of representing it as entertained by a court of
justice. With reference to Shakespeare's handling of this
point it may be noted, first, that he leaves us in doubt
whether the court would have entertained it:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 104.</span>the Duke is
intimating an intention of adjourning at the moment when
the entrance of Portia gives a new turn to the proceedings.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 17.</span>Again, at the opening of the trial, the Duke gives expression
to the universal opinion that Shylock's conduct was intelligible
only on the supposition that he was keeping up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>last moment the appearance of insisting on his strange terms,
in order that before the eyes of the whole city he might
exhibit his enemy at his mercy, and then add to his ignominy
by publicly pardoning him: a fate which, it must be admitted,
was no more than Antonio justly deserved. This will explain
how Shylock comes to have a hearing at all: when once he
is admitted to speak it is exceedingly difficult to resist the
pleas Shakespeare puts into his mouth.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 38.</span>He takes his stand
on the city's charter and the letter of the law, and declines
to be drawn into any discussion of natural justice;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 90.</span>yet even as
a question of natural justice what answer can be found when
he casually points to the institution of slavery, which we
must suppose to have existed in Venice at the period? Shylock's
only offence is his seeking to make Antonio's life a
matter of barter: what else is the accepted institution of
slavery but the establishment of power over human flesh and
blood and life, simply because these have been bought with
money, precisely as Shylock has given good ducats for his
rights over the flesh of Antonio? No wonder the perplexed
Duke is for adjourning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Difficulty
as to the
traditional
mode of
upsetting
the bond
met.</em></div>

<p>There remains one more difficulty, the mode in which,
according to the traditional story, the bond is upset. It is
manifest that the agreement as to the pound of flesh, if it is
to be recognised by a court of justice at all, cannot without
the grossest perversion of justice be cancelled on the ground
of its omitting to mention blood. Legal evasion can go
to great lengths. It is well known that an Act requiring
cabs to carry lamps at night has been evaded through the
omission of a direction that the lamps were to be lighted;
and that importers have escaped a duty on foreign gloves at
so much the pair by bringing the right-hand and left-hand
gloves over in different ships. But it is perfectly possible to
carry lamps without lighting them, while it is a clear impossibility
to cut human flesh without shedding blood. Nothing
of course would be easier than to upset the bond on rational
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>grounds&mdash;indeed the difficulty is rather to imagine it receiving
rational consideration at all; but on the other hand no solution
of the perplexity could be half so dramatic as the one
tradition has preserved. The dramatist has to choose between
a course of procedure which shall be highly dramatic
but leave a sense of injustice, and one that shall be sound
and legal but comparatively tame. Shakespeare contrives
to secure both alternatives. He retains the traditional plea
as to the blood, but puts it into the mouth of one known to
his audience to be a woman playing the lawyer for the nonce;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 314,
347.</span>and again, before we have time to recover from our surprise
and feel the injustice of the proceeding, he follows up the
brilliant evasion by a sound legal plea, the suggestion of a
real lawyer. Portia has come to the court from a conference
with her cousin Bellario, the most learned jurist of Venice.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 47;
<strong>iv.</strong> i. 143.</span>Certainly it was not this doctor who hit upon the idea of the
blood being omitted. His contribution to the interesting consultation
was clearly the old statute of Venice, which every
one else seems to have forgotten, which made the mere
attempt on the life of a citizen by an alien punishable with
death and loss of property: according to this piece of statute
law not only would Shylock's bond be illegal, but the demand
of such security constituted a capital offence. Thus
Shakespeare surmounts the final difficulty in the story of the
Jew in a mode which retains dramatic force to the full, yet
does this without any violation of legal fairness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>The interweaving
of the two
stories.</em></div>

<p>The second purpose of the present study is to show how
Shakespeare has improved his two stories by so weaving
them together that they assist one another's effect.</p>

<p>First, it is easy to see how the whole movement of the
play rises naturally out of the union of the two stories. One
of the main distinctions between the progress of events in
real life or history and in Drama is that the movement of a
drama falls into the form technically known as Complication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>and Resolution.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Complication
and
Resolution.</em></span>A dramatist fastens our attention upon some
train of events: then he sets himself to divert this train of
events from its natural course by some interruption; this
interruption is either removed, and the train of events returns
to its natural course, or the interruption is carried on to some
tragic culmination. In <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> our interest
is at the beginning fixed on Antonio as rich, high-placed, the
protector and benefactor of his friends. By the events following
upon the incident of the bond we see what would seem
the natural life of Antonio diverted into a totally different
channel; in the end the old course is restored, and Antonio
becomes prosperous as before. Such interruption of a train
of incidents is its Complication, and the term Complication
suggests a happy Resolution to follow. Complication and
Resolution are essential to dramatic movement, as discords
and their 'resolution' into concords constitute the essence of
music. <span class="sidenote"><em>The one
story complicated
and resolved
by
the other.</em></span>The Complication and Resolution in the story of the
Jew serve for the Complication and Resolution of the drama
as a whole; and my immediate point is that these elements of
movement in the one story spring directly out of its connection
with the other. <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i, from
122; <strong>i.</strong> iii.</span>But for Bassanio's need of money and
his blunder in applying to Shylock the bond would never have
been entered into, and the change in Antonio's fortunes would
never have come about: thus the cause for all the Complication
of the play (technically, the Complicating Force) is the happy
lover of the Caskets Story. Similarly Portia is the means by
which Antonio's fortunes are restored to their natural flow:
in other words, the source of the Resolution (or Resolving
Force) is the maiden of the Caskets Story. The two leading
personages of the one tale are the sources respectively of the
Complication and Resolution in the other tale, which carry
the Complication and Resolution of the drama as a whole.
Thus simply does the movement of the whole play flow from
the union of the two stories.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The whole play symmetrical
about its
central
scene.</em></div>

<p>One consequence flowing from this is worth noting; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>the scene in which Bassanio makes his successful choice of
the casket is the Dramatic Centre of the whole play, as being
the point in which the Complicating and Resolving Forces
meet. This Dramatic Centre is, according to Shakespeare's
favourite custom, placed in the exact mechanical centre of
the drama, covering the middle of the middle Act. There is
again an amount of poetic splendour lavished upon this
scene which throws it up as a poetic centre to the whole.
More than this, it is the real crisis of the play. Looking philosophically
upon the whole drama as a piece of history, we
must admit that the true turning-point is the success of Bassanio;
the apparent crisis is the Trial Scene, but this is in
reality governed by the scene of the successful choice, and
if Portia and Bassanio had not been united in the earlier
scene no lawyer would have interposed to turn the current
of events in the trial. There is yet another sense in which
the same scene may be called central. Hitherto I have dealt
with only two tales; the full plot however of <em>The Merchant of
Venice</em> involves two more, the Story of Jessica and the
Episode of the Rings: it is to be observed that all four stories
meet in the scene of the successful choice. This scene is
the climax of the Caskets Story.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
221.</span>It is connected with the
catastrophe in the Story of the Jew: Bassanio, at the moment
of his happiness, learns that the friend through whom
he has been able to contend for the prize has forfeited his
life to his foe as the price of his liberality. The scene is
connected with the Jessica Story: for Jessica and her husband
are the messengers who bring the sad tidings, and thus link
together the bright and gloomy elements of the play.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 173-187.</span>Finally,
the Episode of the Rings, which is to occupy the end of the
drama, has its foundation in this scene, in the exchange of the
rings which are destined to be the source of such ironical
perplexity. Such is the symmetry with which the plot of <em>The
Merchant of Venice</em> has been constructed: the incident which
is technically its Dramatic Centre is at once its mechanical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>centre, its poetic centre, and, philosophically considered, its
true turning-point; while, considering the play as a Romantic
drama with its union of stories, we find in the same central
incident all the four stories dovetailed together.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Shakespeare
as
a master
of Plot</em>.</div>

<p>These points may appear small and merely technical. But
is a constant purpose with me in the present exposition of
Shakespeare as a Dramatic Artist to combat the notion, so
widely prevalent amongst ordinary readers, that Shakespeare,
though endowed with the profoundest grasp of human
nature, is yet careless in the construction of his plots: a
notion in itself as improbable as it would be that a sculptor
could be found to produce individual figures exquisitely
moulded and chiselled, yet awkwardly and clumsily grouped.
It is the minuter points that show the finish of an artist; and
such symmetry of construction as appears in <em>The Merchant
of Venice</em> is not likely to characterise a dramatist who sacrifices
plot to character-painting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The union
of a light
with a
serious
story.</em></div>

<p>There remains another point, which no one will consider
small or technical, connected with the union of the two
stories: the fact that Shakespeare has thus united a light and
a serious story, that he has woven together gloom and brightness.
This carries us to one of the great battlefields of
dramatic history; no feature is more characteristic of the
Romantic Drama than this mingling of light and serious in
the same play, and at no point has it been more stoutly
assailed by critics trained in an opposite school. I say
nothing of the wider scope this practice gives to the dramatist,
nor the way in which it brings the world of art nearer
to the world of reality; my present purpose is to review the
dramatic effects which flow from the mingling of the two
elements in the present play.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Dramatic
effects
arising out
of this
union.</em></div>

<p>In general human interest the stories are a counterpoise
to one another, so different in kind, so equal in the degree
of interest their progress continues to call forth. The incidents
of the two tales gather around Antonio and Portia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
respectively; <span class="sidenote"><em>Effects of
Human
Interest.</em></span>each of these is a full and rounded character,
and they are both centres of their respective worlds.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 1.</span>The
stories seem to start from a common point. The keynote to
the story of the Jew is the strange 'sadness'&mdash;the word implies
no more than seriousness&mdash;which overpowers Antonio,
and which seems to be the shadow of his coming trouble.
Compare with this the first words we hear of Portia:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 1.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Such a humorous languor is a fitting precursor to the excitement
and energy of the scenes which follow. But from
this common starting-point the stories move in opposite
directions; the spectator's sympathies are demanded alternately
for two independent chains of circumstances, for the
fortunes of Antonio sinking lower and lower, and the fortunes
of Portia rising higher and higher. He sees the
merchant and citizen become a bankrupt prisoner, the lordly
benefactor of his friends a wretch at the mercy of his foe.
He sees Portia, already endowed with beauty, wealth, and
character, attain what to her heart is yet higher, the power to
lay all she has at the feet of the man she loves. Then, when
they are at the climax of their happiness and misery, when
Portia has received all that this world can bestow, and Antonio
has lost all that this world can take away, for the first
time these two central personages meet face to face in the
Trial Scene. <span class="sidenote"><em>Effects of
Plot.</em></span>And if from general human interest we pass
on to the machinery of plot, we find this also governed by the
same combination: a half-serious frolic is the medium in
which a tragic crisis finds its solution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Emotional
effects: increase
of
tragic
passion;</em></div>

<p>But it is of course passion and emotional interest which
are mainly affected by the union of light and serious: these
we shall appreciate chiefly in connection with the Trial Scene,
where the emotional threads of the play are gathered into
a knot, and the two personages who are the embodiments of
the light and serious elements face one another as judge and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>prisoner.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i, from
225.</span>In this scene it is remarkable how Portia takes
pains to prolong to the utmost extent the crisis she has come
to solve; she holds in her fingers the threads of the tangled
situation, and she is strong enough to play with it before she
will consent to bring it to an end. <span class="sidenote">178.</span>She has intimated her
opinion that the letter of the bond must be maintained,
<span class="sidenote">184-207.</span>she
has made her appeal to Shylock for mercy and been refused,
she has heard Bassanio's appeal to wrest the law for once to
<span class="sidenote">214-222.</span>her authority and has rejected it; there remains nothing but
to pronounce the decree. <span class="sidenote">225.</span>But at the last moment she asks
to see the bond, and every spectator in court holds his
breath and hears his heart beat as he follows the lawyer's eye
down line after line. <span class="sidenote">227-230.</span>It is of no avail; at the end she can
only repeat the useless offer of thrice the loan, with the effect
of drawing from Shylock an oath that he will not give way.
<span class="sidenote">230-244.</span>Then Portia admits that the bond is forfeit, with a needless
reiteration of its horrible details; yet, as if it were some evenly
balanced question, in which after-thoughts were important,
she once more appeals to Shylock to be merciful and bid
her tear the bond, and evokes a still stronger asseveration
from the malignant victor, until even Antonio's stoicism begins
to give way, and he begs for a speedy judgment. <span class="sidenote">243.</span>Portia
then commences to pass her judgment in language of legal
prolixity, which sounds like a recollection of her hour with
Bellario:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">For the intent and purpose of the law</div>
<div class="i0">Hath full relation to the penalty,</div>
<div class="i0">Which here appeareth due upon the bond, &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">255-261.</div>

<p>Next she fads about the details of the judicial barbarity,
the balance to weigh the flesh, a surgeon as a forlorn hope;
and when Shylock demurs to the last, stops to argue that he
might do this for charity. At last surely the intolerable
suspense will come to a termination.
<span class="sidenote">263.</span>But our lawyer of
half-an-hour's standing suddenly remembers she has forgotten
to call on the defendant in the suit, and the pathos is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>intensified by the dying speech of Antonio, calmly welcoming
death for himself, anxious only to soften Bassanio's remorse,
his last human passion a rivalry with Portia for the
love of his friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 276.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">Bid her be judge</div>
<div class="i0">Whether Bassanio had not once a love.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i, from
299.</div>

<p>When the final judgment can be delayed no longer its opening
sentences are still lengthened out by the jingling repetitions
of judicial formality,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The law allows it, and the court awards it, &amp;c.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Only when every evasion has been exhausted comes the
thunderstroke which reverses the whole situation. Now it is
clear that had this situation been intended to have a tragic
termination this prolonging of its details would have been
impossible; thus to harrow our feelings with items of agony
would be not art but barbarity. It is because Portia knows
what termination she is going to give to the scene that she
can indulge in such boldness; it is because the audience
have recognised in Portia the signal of deliverance that the
lengthening of the crisis becomes the dramatic beauty of
suspense. It appears then that, if this scene be regarded only
as a crisis of tragic passion, the dramatist has been able to
extract more <em>tragic</em> effect out of it by the device of assisting
the tragic with a light story.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>reaction
and comic
effect;</em></div>

<p>Again, it is a natural law of the human mind to pass
from strain to reaction, and suspense relieved will find vent
in vehement exhilaration. By giving Portia her position in
the crisis scene the dramatist is clearly furnishing the means
for a reaction to follow, and the reaction is found in the
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i, from
425.</span>Episode of the Rings, by which the disguised wives entangle
their husbands in a perplexity affording the audience the
bursts of merriment needed as relief from the tension of the
Trial Scene. The play is thus brought into conformity with
the laws of mental working, and the effect of the reaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>is to make the serious passion more keen because more
healthy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>effects of
mixed
passion.</em></div>

<p>Finally, there are the effects of mixed passion, neither
wholly serious nor wholly light, but compounded of the two,
which are impossible to a drama that can admit only a
single tone. The effect of Dramatic Irony, which Shakespeare
inherited from the ancient Drama, but greatly
modified and extended, is powerfully illustrated at the most
pathetic point of the Trial Scene,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 273-294.</span>when Antonio's chance
reference to Bassanio's new wife calls from Bassanio and
his followers agonised vows to sacrifice even their wives
if this could save their patron&mdash;little thinking that these
wives are standing by to record the vow. But there is an
effect higher than this.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 184-202.</span>Portia's outburst on the theme of mercy,
considered only as a speech, is one of the noblest in
literature, a gem of purest truth in a setting of richest
music. But the situation in which she speaks it is so framed
as to make Portia herself the embodiment of the mercy she
describes. How can we imagine a higher type of mercy,
the feminine counterpart of justice, than in the bright
woman, at the moment of her supreme happiness, appearing
in the garb of the law to deliver a righteous unfortunate
from his one error, and the justice of Venice from the insoluble
perplexity of having to commit a murder by legal
process? And how is this situation brought about but by the
most intricate interweaving of a story of brightness with a
story of trouble?</p>

<p>In all branches then of dramatic effect, in Character, in
Plot and in Passion, the union of a light with a serious story
is found to be a source of power and beauty. The fault
charged against the Romantic Drama has upon a deeper view
proved a new point of departure in dramatic progress; and
in this particular case the combination of tales so opposite
in character must be regarded as one of the leading points
in which Shakespeare has improved the tales in the telling.</p>

<p>
as it stands in the text at the opening of Shylock's soliloquy. The
expression 'fawning publican' is so totally the opposite of all the
qualities of Antonio that it could have no force even in the mouth of
a satirist. It is impossible not to be attracted by the simple change in
the text that would not only get over this difficulty, but add a new
effect to the scene: the change of assigning this single line to Antonio,
reserving, of course, the rest of the speech for Shylock. The passage
would then read thus [the stage direction is my own]:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Bass.</em> This is Signior Antonio.
</p>
<p>
<em>Ant.</em> [<em>Aside</em>]. How like a fawning publican he looks&mdash;
</p>

<p class="right">

</p>
<p>
<em>Shy.</em> [<em>Aside</em>]. I hate him, for he is a Christian,
But more, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>
Both the terms 'fawning' and 'publican' are literally applicable to
Shylock, and are just what Antonio would be likely to say of him. It
is again a natural effect for the two foes on meeting for the first time in
the play to exchange scowling defiance. Antonio's defiance is cut short
at the first line by Bassanio's running up to him, explaining what he has
done, and bringing Antonio up to where Shylock is standing; the time
occupied in doing this gives Shylock scope for his longer soliloquy.</p></div></div>

architect's problem has been to support a heavy weight
without the assistance of pillars, and it might have been
expected that in solving the problem he would at least have
tried every means in his power for diminishing the weight to
be supported. On the contrary, he has increased this weight
by the addition of massive cross-beams and heavy iron-girders.
Yet, if these have been arranged according to the
laws of construction, each of them will bring a supporting
power considerably greater than its own weight; and thus,
while in a literal sense increasing the roof, for all practical
purposes they may be said to have diminished it. Similarly
a dramatist of the Romantic school, from his practice of
uniting more than one story in the same plot, has to face the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>difficulty of complexity. This difficulty he solves not by seeking
how to reduce combinations as far as possible, but, on
the contrary, by the addition of more and inferior stories;
yet if these new stories are so handled as to emphasise
and heighten the effect of the main stories, the additional
complexity will have resulted in increased simplicity. In the
play at present under consideration, Shakespeare has interwoven
into a common pattern two famous and striking tales;
his plot, already elaborate, he has made yet more elaborate
by the addition of two more tales less striking in their
character&mdash;the Story of Jessica and the Episode of the Rings.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The Jessica
Story and
the Rings
Episode
assist the
main stories.</em></span>If it can be shown that these inferior stories have the effect
of assisting the main stories, smoothing away their difficulties
and making their prominent points yet more prominent, it
will be clear that he has made his plot more complex only in
reality to make it more simple. The present study is devoted
to noticing how the Stories of Jessica and of the Rings
minister to the effects of the Story of the Jew and the
Caskets Story.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Jessica
Story. It
serves as
Underplot
for mechanical
personages.</em></div>

<p>To begin with: it may be seen that in many ways the
mechanical working out of the main stories is assisted by the
Jessica story. In the first place it relieves them of their
superfluous personages. Every drama, however simple, must
contain 'mechanical' personages, who are introduced into
the play, not for their own sake, but to assist in presenting
incidents or other personages. The tendency of Romantic
Drama to put a story as a whole upon the stage multiplies
the number of such mechanical personages: and when
several such stories come to be combined in one, there is a
danger of the stage being crowded with characters which
intrinsically have little interest. Here the Underplots become
of service and find occupation for these inferior personages.
In the present case only four personages are essential
to the main plot&mdash;Antonio, Shylock, Bassanio, Portia.
But in bringing out the unusual tie that binds together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>a representative of the city and a representative of the
nobility,
<span class="sidenote">e.g. <strong>i.</strong> i;
<strong>iii.</strong> iii;
<strong>iv.</strong> i.</span>and upon which so much of the plot rests, it is an
assistance to introduce the rank and file of gay society and
depict these paying court to the commercial magnate. The
high position of Antonio and Bassanio in their respective
spheres will come out still clearer if these lesser social personages
are graduated.
<span class="sidenote">
<strong>i.</strong> i; compare <strong>iii.</strong> i. esp. 14-18.</span>
Salanio, Salerio, and Salarino are mere parasites;
Gratiano has a certain amount of individuality
in his wit; <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 74-118.
<strong>i.</strong> ii. 124.
<strong>v.</strong> i, &amp;c.
<strong>i.</strong> ii, &amp;c.
<strong>iii.</strong> i. 80, &amp;c.
</span>
while, seeing that Bassanio is a scholar
as well as a nobleman and soldier,
it is fitting to give prominence
amongst his followers to the intellectual and artistic
Lorenzo.
Similarly the introduction of Nerissa assists in
presenting Portia fully;
Shylock is seen in his relations with
his race by the aid of Tubal, his family life is seen in connection
with Jessica, and his behaviour to dependants in
connection with Launcelot; Launcelot himself is set off by
Gobbo. Now the Jessica story is mainly devoted to these inferior
personages, and the majority of them take an animated
part in the successful elopement. It is further to be noted
that the Jessica Underplot has itself an inferior story attached
to it,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. iii;
<strong>iii.</strong> v.</span>that of Launcelot, who seeks scope for his good nature
by transferring himself to a Christian master, just as his
mistress seeks a freer social atmosphere in union with a
Christian husband. And, similarly, side by side with the
Caskets Story, which unites Portia and Bassanio,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 188,
&amp;c.</span>we have a
faintly-marked underplot which unites their followers, Nerissa
and Gratiano. In one or other of these inferior stories the
mechanical personages find attachment to plot; and the
multiplication of individual figures, instead of leaving an
impression of waste, is made to minister to the sense of
Dramatic Economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>It assists
mechanical
development:
occupying
the three months' interval,</em></div>

<p>Again: as there are mechanical personages so there are
mechanical difficulties&mdash;difficulties of realisation which do not
belong to the essence of a story, but which appear when the
story comes to be worked out upon the stage. The Story of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>the Jew involves such a mechanical difficulty in the interval
of three months which elapses between the signing of the
bond and its forfeiture. In a classical setting this would be
avoided by making the play begin on the day the bond falls
due; such treatment, however, would shut out the great
dramatic opportunity of the Bond Scene. The Romantic
Drama always inclines to exhibiting the whole of a story; it
must therefore in the present case <em>suppose</em> a considerable
interval between one part of the story and another, and such
suppositions tend to be weaknesses. The Jessica Story conveniently
bridges over this interval. The first Act is given
up to bringing about the bond, which at the beginning of the
third Act appears to be broken. The intervening Act consists
of no less than nine scenes, and while three of them carry
on the progress of the Caskets Story, the other six are
devoted to the elopement of Jessica: the bustle and activity
implied in such rapid change of scene indicating how an
underplot can be used to keep the attention of the audience
just where the natural interest of the main story would flag.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>and so
breaking
gradually
the news of
Antonio's
losses.</em></div>

<p>The same use of the Jessica Story to bridge over the
three months' interval obviates another mechanical difficulty
of the main plot. The loss of all Antonio's ships, the
supposition that all the commercial ventures of so prudent a
merchant should simultaneously miscarry, is so contrary to
the chances of things as to put some strain upon our sense
of probability; and this is just one of the details which, too
unimportant to strike us in an anecdote, become realised
when a story is presented before our eyes. The artist, it
must be observed, is not bound to find actual solutions for
every possible difficulty; he has merely to see that they do
not interfere with dramatic effect. Sometimes he so arranges
his incidents that the difficulty is met and vanishes; sometimes
it is kept out of sight, the portion of the story which
contains it going on behind the scenes; at other times he is
content with reducing the difficulty in amount. In the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>instance the improbability of Antonio's losses is lessened
by the gradual way in which the news is broken to us,
distributed amongst the numerous scenes of the three months'
interval.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> viii. 25.</span>We get the first hint of it in a chance conversation
between Salanio and Salarino, in which they are
chuckling over the success of the elopement and the fury of
the robbed father. Salanio remarks that Antonio must look
that he keep his day; this reminds Salarino of a ship he has
just heard of as lost somewhere in the English Channel:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I thought upon Antonio when he told me;</div>
<div class="i0">And wish'd in silence that it were not his.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i.</div>
<p>In the next scene but one the same personages meet, and
one of them, enquiring for the latest news, is told that the
rumour yet lives of Antonio's loss, and now the exact place
of the wreck is specified as the Goodwin Sands; Salarino
adds: 'I would it might prove the end of his losses.'
Before the close of the scene Shylock and Tubal have been
added to it. Tubal has come from Genoa and gives Shylock
the welcome news that at Genoa it was <em>known</em> that Antonio
had lost an argosy coming from Tripolis; while on his
journey to Venice Tubal had travelled with creditors of
Antonio who were speculating upon his bankruptcy as a
certainty.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii.</span>Then comes the central scene in which the full
news reaches Bassanio at the moment of his happiness: all
Antonio's ventures failed&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</div>
<div class="i0">From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>not one escaped. <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii.</span>In the following scene we see Antonio in
custody.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Jessica
Story
assists
Dramatic
Hedging in
regard to
Shylock.</em></div>

<p>These are minor points such as may be met with in any
play, and the treatment of them belongs to ordinary Dramatic
Mechanism. But we have already had to notice that
the Story of the Jew contains special difficulties which belong
to the essence of the story, and must be met by special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>devices.
One of these was the monstrous character of the
Jew himself; and we saw how the dramatist was obliged to
maintain in the spectators a double attitude to Shylock,
alternately letting them be repelled by his malignity and
again attracting their sympathy to him as a victim of wrong.
Nothing in the play assists this double attitude so much as
the Jessica Story. Not to speak of the fact that Shylock
shows no appreciation for the winsomeness of the girl who
attracts every one else in the drama, nor of the way in which
this one point of brightness in the Jewish quarter throws up
the sordidness of all her surroundings,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 2.</span>we hear the Jew's
own daughter reflect that his house is a 'hell,' and we see
enough of his domestic life to agree with her.
<span class="sidenote">e.g. <strong>ii.</strong> v.</span>A Shylock
painted without a tender side at all would be repulsive; he
becomes much more repulsive when he shows a tenderness
for one human being, and yet it appears how this tenderness
has grown hard and rotten with the general debasement of
his soul by avarice, until, in his ravings over his loss,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i, from
25.</span>his
ducats and his daughter are ranked as equally dear.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 92.</div>
<blockquote>
<p>
I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in
her ear! Would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her
coffin!</p></blockquote>

<p>For all this we feel that he is hardly used in losing her.
Paternal feeling may take a gross form, but it is paternal
feeling none the less, and cannot be denied our sympathy;
bereavement is a common ground upon which not only high
and low, but even the pure and the outcast, are drawn
together. Thus Jessica at home makes us hate Shylock:
with Jessica lost we cannot help pitying him. The perfection
of Dramatic Hedging lies in the equal balancing of
the conflicting feelings, and one of the most powerful
scenes in the whole play is devoted to this twofold display of
Shylock. Fresh from the incident of the elopement, he is
encountered by the parasites and by Tubal: these amuse
themselves with alternately 'chaffing' him upon his losses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>and 'drawing' him in the matter of the expected gratification
of his vengeance, while his passions rock him between
extremes of despair and fiendish anticipation.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Jessica
Shakespeare's
compensation
to
Shylock.</em></span>We may go
further. Great creative power is accompanied by great
attachment to the creations and keen sense of justice in disposing
of them. Looked at as a whole, the Jessica Story is
Shakespeare's compensation to Shylock.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 348-394.</span>The sentence on
Shylock, which the necessities of the story require, is legal
rather than just; yet large part of it consists in a requirement
that he shall make his daughter an heiress. And, to
put it more generally, the repellent character and hard fate
of the father have set against them the sweetness and beauty
of the daughter, together with the full cup of good fortune
which her wilful rebellion brings her in the love of Lorenzo
and the protecting friendship of Portia. Perhaps the dramatist,
according to his wont, is warning us of this compensating
treatment when he makes one of the characters early in the
play exclaim:</p>
 <div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 34.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,</div>
<div class="i0">It will be for his gentle daughter's sake.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><em>The Jessica
Story explains
Shylock's
unyieldingness.</em></div>

<p>The other main source of difficulty in the Story of the
Jew is, as we have seen, the detail concerning the pound of
flesh, which throws improbability over every stage of its
progress. In one at least of these stages the difficulty is
directly met by the aid of the Jessica Story: it is this which explains
Shylock's resolution not to give way. When we try in
imagination to realise the whole circumstances, common sense
must take the view taken in the play itself by the Duke:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 17.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</div>
<div class="i0">That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice</div>
<div class="i0">To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought</div>
<div class="i0">Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange</div>
<div class="i0">Than is thy strange apparent cruelty.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>A life-long training in avarice would not easily resist an
offer of nine thousand ducats. But further, the alternatives
between which Shylock has to choose are not so simple as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>the alternatives of Antonio's money or his life. On the one
hand, Shylock has to consider the small chance that either
the law or the mob would actually suffer the atrocity to be
judicially perpetrated, and how his own life would be likely
to be lost in the attempt. Again, turning to the other alternative,
Shylock is certainly deep in his schemes of vengeance,
and the finesse of malignity must have suggested to
him how much more cruel to a man of Antonio's stamp it
would be to fling him a contemptuous pardon before the
eyes of Venice than to turn him into a martyr, even supposing
this to be permitted. But at the moment when the
choice becomes open to Shylock he has been maddened by
the loss of his daughter, who, with the wealth she has stolen,
has gone to swell the party of his deadly foe. It is fury, not
calculating cruelty, that makes Shylock with a madman's
tenacity cling to the idea of blood, while this passion is
blinding him to a more keenly flavoured revenge, and risking
the chance of securing any vengeance at all<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Jessica
Story assists
the interweaving
of
the main
stories.</em></div>

<p>From the mechanical development of the main plot and
the reduction of its difficulties, we pass to the interweaving of
the two principal stories, which is so leading a feature of the
play. In the main this interweaving is sufficiently provided
for by the stories themselves, and we have already seen how
the leading personages in the one story are the source of the
whole movement in the other story. But this interweaving
is drawn closer still by the affair of Jessica: <span class="sidenote"><em>It is thus
a Link
Action,</em></span>technically
described the position in the plot of Jessica's elopement is
that of a Link Action between the main stories. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>linking appears in the way in which Jessica and her suite
are in the course of the drama transferred from the one tale
to the other. At the opening of the play they are personages
in the Story of the Jew, and represent its two antagonistic
sides, Jessica being the daughter of the Jew and Lorenzo a
friend and follower of Bassanio and Antonio. First the
contrivance of the elopement assists in drawing together
these opposite sides of the Jew Story, and aggravating the
feud on which it turns. <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
221.</span>Then, as we have seen, Jessica and
her husband in the central scene of the whole play come into
contact with the Caskets Story at its climax. From this point
they become adopted into the Caskets Story, and settle down
in the house and under the protection of Portia. <span class="sidenote"><em>helping to
restore the
balance between
the
main
stories,</em></span>This
transference further assists the symmetry of interweaving by
helping to adjust the balance between the two main stories.
In its <em>mass</em>, if the expression may be allowed, the Caskets
tale, with its steady progress to a goal of success, is over-weighted
by the tale of Antonio's tragic peril and startling
deliverance: the Jessica episode, withdrawn from the one
and added to the other, helps to make the two more
equal. Once more, the case, we have seen, is not merely
that of a union between stories, but a union between stories
opposite in kind, a combination of brightness with gloom.
<span class="sidenote"><em>and a bond
between
their bright
and dark
climaxes.</em></span>The binding effect of the Jessica Story extends to the union
between these opposite tones. We have already had occasion
to notice how the two extremes meet in the central scene, how
from the height of Bassanio's bliss we pass in an instant to
the total ruin of Antonio, which we then learn in its fulness
for the first time: the link which connects the two is the
arrival of Jessica and her friends as bearers of the news.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Character
effects. Character
of
Jessica.</em></div>

<p>So far, the points considered have been points of Mechanism
and Plot; in the matter of Character-Interest the Jessica
episode is to an even greater degree an addition to the whole
effect of the play, Jessica and Lorenzo serving as a foil to
Portia and Bassanio. The characters of Jessica and Lorenzo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>are charmingly sketched, though liable to misreading unless
carefully studied. To appreciate Jessica we must in the first
place assume the grossly unjust mediæval view of the Jews as
social outcasts. <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> v.</span>The dramatist has vouchsafed us a glimpse
of Shylock at home, and brief as the scene is it is remarkable
how much of evil is crowded into it. The breath of
home life is trust, yet the one note which seems to pervade
the domestic bearing of Shylock is the lowest suspiciousness.
<span class="sidenote">12, 16, 36.</span>Three times as he is starting for Bassanio's supper he draws
back to question the motives for which he has been invited.
He is moved to a shriek of suspicion by the mere fact of his
servant joining him in shouting for the absent Jessica, <span class="sidenote">7.</span>by the
mention of masques, by the sight of the servant whispering
to his daughter <span class="sidenote">28, 44.</span>Finally, he takes his leave with the words</p>

<div class="sidenote">52.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Perhaps I will return immediately,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>a device for keeping order in his absence which would be
a low one for a nurse to use to a child, but which he is not
ashamed of using to his grown-up daughter and the lady of
his house. The short scene of fifty-seven lines is sufficient
to give us a further reminder of Shylock's sordid house-keeping,
which is glad to get rid of the good-natured
Launcelot as a 'huge feeder'; <span class="sidenote">3, 46.</span>and his aversion to any form
of gaiety, which leads him to insist on his shutters being put
up when he hears that there is a chance of a pageant in
the streets <span class="sidenote">28.</span>Amidst surroundings of this type Jessica has
grown up, a motherless girl, mingling only with harsh men
(for we nowhere see a trace of female companionship for
her):
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 20.</span>it can hardly be objected against her that she should
long for a Christian atmosphere in which her affections might
have full play. Yet even for this natural reaction she feels
compunction:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 16.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Alack, what heinous sin is it in me</div>
<div class="i0">To be ashamed to be my father's child!</div>
<div class="i0">But though I am a daughter to his blood,</div>
<div class="i0">I am not to his manners.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>

Formed amidst such influences it would be a triumph to a
character if it escaped repulsiveness; Jessica, on the contrary,
is full of attractions. She has a simplicity which stands to
her in the place of principle. More than this she has a high
degree of feminine delicacy. Delicacy will be best brought
out in a person who is placed in an equivocal situation, and
we see Jessica engaged, not only in an elopement, but in an
elopement which,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 30.</span>it appears, has throughout been planned by
herself and not by Lorenzo. Of course a quality like feminine
delicacy is more conveyed by the bearing of the actress than
by positive words; we may however notice the impression
which Jessica's part in the elopement scenes makes upon
those who are present.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 30-40.</span>When Lorenzo is obliged to make a
confidant of Gratiano, and tell him how it is Jessica who has
planned the whole affair, instead of feeling any necessity of
apologising for her the thought of her childlike innocence
moves him to enthusiasm, and it is here that he exclaims:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,</div>
<div class="i0">It will be for his gentle daughter's sake.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> vi.</div>

<p>In the scene of the elopement itself, Jessica has steered clear
of both prudishness and freedom, and when after her pretty
confusion she has retired from the window, even Gratiano
breaks out:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> vi. 51.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew;</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>while Lorenzo himself has warmed to see in her qualities
he had never expected:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> vi. 52.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Beshrew me but I love her heartily;</div>
<div class="i0">For she is wise, if I can judge of her,</div>
<div class="i0">And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,</div>
<div class="i0">And true she is, as she has proved herself,</div>
<div class="i0">And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,</div>
<div class="i0">Shall she be placed in my constant soul.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>So generally, all with whom she comes into contact feel
her spell:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 10.</span>the rough Launcelot parts from her with tears he
is ashamed of yet cannot keep down;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 41.</span>Salarino&mdash;the last of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>men to take high views of women&mdash;resents as a sort of blasphemy
Shylock's claiming her as his flesh and blood;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv, v;
<strong>v.</strong> i.</span>while
between Jessica and Portia there seems to spring in an
instant an attraction as mysterious as is the tie between
Antonio and Bassanio.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Character
of Lorenzo.</em></div>

<p>Lorenzo is for the most part of a dreamy inactive nature,
as may be seen in his amused tolerance of Launcelot's
word-fencing<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v. 44-75.</span>&mdash;word-fencing being in general a challenge
which none of Shakespeare's characters can resist; similarly,
Jessica's enthusiasm on the subject of Portia, which in reality
he shares, he prefers to meet with banter:</p>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v. 75-89.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Even such a husband</div>
<div class="i0">Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the strong side of his character also is shown us in the
play:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i. 1-24,
54-88.</span>he has an artist soul, and to the depth of his passion
for music and for the beauty of nature we are indebted for
some of the noblest passages in Shakespeare. This is the
attraction which has drawn him to Jessica, her outer beauty
is the index of artistic sensibility within:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i. 69, 1-24.</span>'she is never merry
when she hears sweet music,' and the soul of rhythm is
awakened in her, just as much as in her husband, by the
moonlight scene. Simplicity again, is a quality they have
in common, as is seen by their ignorance in money-matters,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 113,
123.</span>and the way a valuable turquoise ring goes for a
monkey&mdash;if, at least, Tubal may be believed: a carelessness
of money which mitigates our dislike of the free hand Jessica
lays upon her father's ducats and jewels. On the whole,
however, Lorenzo's dreaminess makes a pretty contrast to
Jessica's vivacity. And Lorenzo's inactivity is capable of
being roused to great things. This is seen by the elopement
itself:
<span class="sidenote">esp. <strong>ii.</strong> iv.
20, 30; <strong>ii.</strong>
vi. 30. &amp;c.</span>for the suggestion of its incidents seems to be that
Lorenzo meant at first no more than trifling with the
pretty Jewess, and that he rose to the occasion as he found
and appreciated Jessica's higher tone and attraction.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 24,
32.</span>Finally,
we must see the calibre of Lorenzo's character through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>eyes of Portia, who selects him at first sight as the representative
to whom to commit her household in her absence, of
which commission she will take no refusal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Jessica and
Lorenzo a
foil to Portia
and
Bassanio.</em></div>

<p>So interpreted the characters of Jessica and Lorenzo
make the whole episode of the elopement an antithesis to the
main plot. To a wedded couple in the fresh happiness of
their union there can hardly fall a greater luxury than to
further the happiness of another couple; this luxury is
granted to Portia and Bassanio, and in their reception of the
fugitives what picturesque contrasts are brought together!
The two pairs are a foil to one another in kind, and set one
another off like gold and gems. Lorenzo and Jessica are
negative characters with the one positive quality of intense
capacity for enjoyment; Bassanio and Portia have everything
to enjoy, yet their natures appear dormant till roused by
an occasion for daring and energy. The Jewess and her
husband are distinguished by the bird-like simplicity that so
often goes with special art-susceptibility; Portia and Bassanio
are full and rounded characters in which the whole of
human nature seems concentrated. The contrast is of degree
as well as kind: the weaker pair brought side by side with
the stronger throw out the impression of their strength.
Portia has a fulness of power which puts her in her most
natural position when she is extending protection to those
who are less able to stand by themselves. Still more with
Bassanio: he has so little scope in the scenes of the play
itself, which from the nature of the stories present him always
in situations of dependence on others, that we see his strength
almost entirely by the reflected light of the attitude which
others hold to him; in the present instance we have no
difficulty in catching the intellectual power of Lorenzo, and
Lorenzo looks up to Bassanio as a superior. And the
couples thus contrasted in character present an equal likeness
and unlikeness in their fortunes. Both are happy for
ever, and both have become so through a bold stroke. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>in the one instance it is blind obedience, in face of all temptations,
to the mere whims of a good parent, who is dead, that
has been guided to the one issue so passionately desired; in
the case of the other couple open rebellion, at every practical
risk, against the legitimate authority of an evil father, still
living, has brought them no worse fate than happiness in one
another, and for their defenceless position the best of
patrons.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the introduction of the Jessica Story is
justified, not only by the purposes of construction which it
serves, but by the fact that its human interest is at once a
contrast and a supplement to the main story, with which
it blends to produce the ordered variety of a finished
picture.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Rings
Episode
assists the
mechanism
of the main
stories,</em></div>

<p>A few words will be sufficient to point out how the effects
of the main plot are assisted by the Rings Episode, which,
though rich in fun, is of a slighter character than the Jessica
Story, and occupies a much smaller space in the field of view.
The dramatic points of the two minor stories are similar.
Like the Jessica Story the Rings Episode assists the mechanical
working out of the main plot. An explanation
must somehow be given to Bassanio that the lawyer is Portia
in disguise; mere mechanical explanations have always an
air of weakness, but the affair of the rings utilises the
explanation in the present case as a source of new dramatic
effects. This arrangement further assists, to a certain extent,
in reducing the improbability of Portia's project. The point
at which the improbability would be most felt would be, not
the first appearance of the lawyer's clerk, for then we are
engrossed in our anxiety for Antonio, but when the explanation
of the disguise came to be made; there might be a
danger lest here the surprise of Bassanio should become
infectious, and the audience should awake to the improbability
of the whole story: as it is, their attention is at the
critical moment diverted to the perplexity of the penitent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>husbands.
<span class="sidenote"><em>and their
interweaving;</em></span>The Story of the Rings, like that of Jessica, assists
the interweaving of the two main stories with one another,
its subtlety suggesting to what a degree of detail this interlacing
extends. Bassanio is the main point which unites the
Story of the Jew and the Caskets Story; in the one he
occupies the position of friend, in the other of husband.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 425-454.</span>The affair of the rings, slight as it is, is so managed by
Portia that its point becomes a test as between his friendship
and his love; and so equal do these forces appear that,
though his friendship finally wins and he surrenders his
betrothal ring, yet it is not until after his wife has given him
a hint against herself:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">An if your wife be not a mad-woman,</div>
<div class="i0">And know how well I have deserved the ring,</div>
<div class="i0">She would not hold out enemy for ever</div>
<div class="i0">For giving it to me.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The Rings Episode, even more than the Jessica Story, assists
in restoring the balance between the main tales. The chief
inequality between them lies in the fact that the Jew Story is
complicated and resolved, while the Caskets Story is a simple
progress to a goal; when, however, there springs from the
latter a sub-action which has a highly comic complication
and resolution the two halves of the play become dramatically
on a par. And the interweaving of the dark and
bright elements in the play is assisted by the fact that the
Episode of the Rings not only provides a comic reaction
to relieve the tragic crisis, but its whole point is a Dramatic
Irony in which serious and comic are inextricably mixed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>and assists
in the development
of Portia's
character.</em></div>

<p>Finally, as the Jessica Story ministers to Character effect in
connection with the general ensemble of the personages, so
the Episode of the Rings has a special function in bringing
out the character of Portia. The secret of the charm which
has won for Portia the suffrages of all readers is the perfect
balance of qualities in her character: she is the meeting-point
of brightness, force, and tenderness. And, to crown the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>union, Shakespeare has placed her at the supreme moment of
life, on the boundary line between girlhood and womanhood,
when the wider aims and deeper issues of maturity find
themselves in strange association with the abandon of youth.
The balance thus becomes so perfect that it quivers, and dips
to one side and the other.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 39.</span>Portia is the saucy child as she
sprinkles her sarcasms over Nerissa's enumeration of the
suitors: in the trial she faces the world of Venice as a
heroine.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 150.</span>She is the ideal maiden in the speech in which she
surrenders herself to Bassanio:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 184.</span>she is the ideal woman as
she proclaims from the judgment seat the divinity of mercy.
Now the fourth Act has kept before us too exclusively one
side of this character. Not that Portia in the lawyer's gown
is masculine: but the dramatist has had to dwell too long on
her side of strength. He will not dismiss us with this impression,
but indulges us in one more daring feat surpassing
all the madcap frolics of the past. Thus the Episode of the
Rings is the last flicker of girlhood in Portia before it merges
in the wider life of womanhood. We have rejoiced in a great
deliverance wrought by a noble woman: our enjoyment rises
higher yet when the Rings Episode reminds us that this
woman has not ceased to be a sportive girl.</p>

<p>It has been shown, then, that the two inferior stories in
<em>The Merchant of Venice</em> assist the main stories in the most
varied manner, smoothing their mechanical working, meeting
their special difficulties, drawing their mutual interweaving
yet closer, and throwing their character effects into relief:
the additional complexity they have brought has resulted in
making emphatic points yet more prominent, and the total
effect has therefore been to increase clearness and simplicity.
Enough has now been said on the building up of Dramas out
of Stories, which is the distinguishing feature of the Romantic
Drama; the studies that follow will be applied to the more
universal topics of dramatic interest, Character, Plot, and
Passion.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">A picture of Ideal Villainy in
Richard III.</span></p>

<p class="right"><em>A Study in Character-Interpretation.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote">
<em>Villainy as
a subject
for art-treatment.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">I HOPE that the subject of the present study will not be
considered by any reader forbidding. On the contrary,
there is surely attractiveness in the thought that nothing is so
repulsive or so uninteresting in the world of fact but in some
way or other it may be brought under the dominion of art-beauty.
The author of <em>L'Allegro</em> shows by the companion
poem that he could find inspiration in a rainy morning; and
the great master in English poetry is followed by a great
master in English painting who wins his chief triumphs by
his handling of fog and mist. Long ago the masterpiece of
Virgil consecrated agricultural toil; Murillo's pictures have
taught us that there is a beauty in rags and dirt; rustic
commonplaces gave a life passion to Wordsworth, and were
the cause of a revolution in poetry; while Dickens has penetrated
into the still less promising region of low London life,
and cast a halo around the colourless routine of poverty.
Men's evil passions have given Tragedy to art, crime is
beautified by being linked to Nemesis, meanness is the
natural source for brilliant comic effects, ugliness has reserved
for it a special form of art in the grotesque, and pain becomes
attractive in the light of the heroism that suffers and the
devotion that watches. In the infancy of modern English
poetry Drayton found a poetic side to topography and maps,
and Phineas Fletcher idealised anatomy; while of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>greatest imaginations belonging to the modern world Milton
produced his masterpiece in the delineation of a fiend, and
Dante in a picture of hell. The final triumph of good over
evil seems to have been already anticipated by art.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The
villainy of
Richard
ideal in its
scale,</em></div>

<p>The portrait of Richard satisfies a first condition of ideality
in the scale of the whole picture. The sphere in which he
is placed is not private life, but the world of history, in which
moral responsibility is the highest: if, therefore, the quality
of other villainies be as fine, here the issues are deeper.
<span class="sidenote"><em>and in its
fulness of
development.</em></span>As another element of the ideal, the villainy of Richard is presented
to us fully developed and complete. Often an artist
of crime will rely&mdash;as notably in the portraiture of Tito
Melema&mdash;mainly on the succession of steps by which a character,
starting from full possession of the reader's sympathies,
arrives by the most natural gradations at a height of evil which
shocks. In the present case all idea of growth is kept outside
the field of this particular play; the opening soliloquy
announces a completed process:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 30.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I am determined to prove a villain.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>What does appear of Richard's past, seen through the
favourable medium of a mother's description, only seems to
extend the completeness to earlier stages:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iv. 167.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;</div>
<div class="i0">Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;</div>
<div class="i0">Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,</div>
<div class="i0">Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,</div>
<div class="i0">Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, bloody, treacherous,</div>
<div class="i0">More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So in the details of the play there is nowhere a note of the
hesitation that betrays tentative action. When even Buckingham
is puzzled as to what can be done if Hastings should
resist, Richard answers:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 193.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>His choice is only between different modes of villainy, never
between villainy and honesty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>It has no
sufficient
motive.</em></div>

<p>Again, it is to be observed that there is no suggestion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
impelling motive or other explanation for the villainy of
Richard. He does not labour under any sense of personal
injury, such as Iago felt in believing, however groundlessly,
<span class="sidenote"><em>Othello</em>: <strong>i.</strong>
iii. 392, &amp;c.</span>that his enemies had wronged him through his wife;
<span class="sidenote"><em>Lear</em>: <strong>i.</strong> ii.
1-22.</span>or Edmund, whose soliloquies display him as conscious that his
birth has made his whole life an injury. Nor have we in this
case the morbid enjoyment of suffering which we associate
with Mephistopheles, and which Dickens has worked up into
one of his most powerful portraits in Quilp. Richard never
turns aside to gloat over the agonies of his victims; it is not
so much the details as the grand schemes of villainy, the
handling of large combinations of crime, that have an interest
for him: he is a strategist in villainy, not a tactician. Nor
can we point to ambition as a sufficient motive. He is
ambitious in a sense which belongs to all vigorous natures;
he has the workman's impulse to rise by his work. But
ambition as a determining force in character must imply
more than this; it is a sort of moral dazzling, its symptom is
a fascination by ends which blinds to the ruinous means
leading up to these ends. Such an ambition was Macbeth's;
but in Richard the symptoms are wanting, and in all his long
soliloquies he is never found dwelling upon the prize in view.
A nearer approach to an explanation would be Richard's
sense of bodily deformity. Not only do all who come in
contact with him shrink from the 'bottled spider,'
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 242,
228; <strong>iv.</strong> iv.
81, &amp;c.</span>but he
himself gives a conspicuous place in his meditations to the
thought of his ugliness; from the outset he connects his
criminal career with the reflection that he 'is not shaped for
sportive tricks:'</p>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 14.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time</div>
<div class="i0">Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</div>
<div class="i0">And that so lamely and unfashionable</div>
<div class="i0">That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</div>
<div class="i0">Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</div>
<div class="i0">Have no delight to pass away the time,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
<div class="i0">Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</div>
<div class="i0">And descant on mine own deformity.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Still, it would be going too far to call this the motive of his
crimes: the spirit of this and similar passages is more
accurately expressed by saying that he has a morbid pleasure
in contemplating physical ugliness analogous to his morbid
pleasure in contemplating moral baseness.</p> <div class="sidenote">esp. <strong>i.</strong> ii.
252-264.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Villainy
has become
to Richard
an end in
itself.</em></div>

<p>There appears, then, no sufficient explanation and motive
for the villainy of Richard: the general impression conveyed
is that to Richard villainy has become an end in itself needing
no special motive. This is one of the simplest principles of
human development&mdash;that a means to an end tends to become
in time an end in itself. The miser who began accumulating
to provide comforts for his old age finds the process
itself of accumulating gain firmer and firmer hold upon him,
until, when old age has come, he sticks to accumulating and
foregoes comfort. So in previous plays Gloster may have
been impelled by ambition to his crimes: <span class="sidenote">compare
<em>3 Henry
VI:</em> <strong>iii.</strong> ii.
165-181.</span>by the time the
present play is reached crime itself becomes to him the dearer
of the two, and the ambitious end drops out of sight. This
leads directly to one of the two main features of Shakespeare's
portrait: Richard is an <em>artist in villainy</em>.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Richard an
artist in
villainy.</em></span>What form and
colour are to the painter, what rhythm and imagery are to
the poet, that crime is to Richard: it is the medium in which
his soul frames its conceptions of the beautiful. The gulf
that separates between Shakespeare's Richard and the rest of
humanity is no gross perversion of sentiment, nor the development
of abnormal passions, nor a notable surrender in the
struggle between interest and right. It is that he approaches
villainy as a thing of pure intellect, a region of moral indifference
in which sentiment and passion have no place, attraction
to which implies no more motive than the simplest impulse to
exercise a native talent in its natural sphere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Richard
lacks the
emotions naturally
attending
crime.</em></div>

<p>Of the various barriers that exist against crime, the most
powerful are the checks that come from human emotions. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>is easier for a criminal to resist the objections his reason
interposes to evildoing than to overcome these emotional
restraints: either his own emotions, woven by generations of
hereditary transmission into the very framework of his
nature, which make his hand tremble in the act of sinning;
or the emotions his crimes excite in others, such as will
cause hardened wretches, who can die calmly on the scaffold,
to cower before the menaces of a mob. Crime becomes
possible only because these emotions can be counteracted by
more powerful emotions on the other side, by greed, by thirst
for vengeance, by inflamed hatred. In Richard, however,
when he is surveying his works, we find no such evil emotions
raised, no gratified vengeance or triumphant hatred. The
reason is that there is in him no restraining emotion to be
overcome. Horror at the unnatural is not subdued, but
absent;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii.</span>his attitude to atrocity is the passionless attitude of
the artist who recognises that the tyrant's cruelty can be set
to as good music as the martyr's heroism. Readers are
shocked at the scene in which Richard wooes Lady Anne
beside the bier of the parent he has murdered, and wonder
that so perfect an intriguer should not choose a more favourable
time. But the repugnance of the reader has no place in
Richard's feelings: the circumstances of the scene are so
many <em>objections</em>, to be met by so much skill of treatment. A
single detail in the play illustrates perfectly this neutral attitude
to horror. Tyrrel comes to bring the news of the
princes' murder; Richard answers:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 31.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,</div>
<div class="i0">And thou shalt tell the process of their death.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Quilp could not have waited for his gloating till after supper;
other villains would have put the deed out of sight when done;
the epicure in villainy reserves his <em>bonbouche</em> till he has leisure
to do it justice. Callous to his own emotions, he is equally
callous to the emotions he rouses in others. When Queen
Margaret is pouring a flood of curses which make the innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>courtiers' hair stand on end, and the heaviest curse of
all, which she has reserved for Richard himself, <span class="sidenote">
<strong>i.</strong> iii. 216-239.</span>is rolling on
its climax,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!</div>
<div class="i0">Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!</div>
<div class="i0">Thou rag of honour! thou detested&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he adroitly slips in the word 'Margaret' in place of the
intended 'Richard,' and thus, with the coolness of a schoolboy's
small joke, disconcerts her tragic passion in a way that
gives a moral wrench to the whole scene.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iv, from
136.</span>His own mother's
curse moves him not even to anger; he caps its clauses with
bantering repartees, until he seizes an opportunity for a pun,
and begins to move off:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 109.</span>he treats her curse, as in a previous
scene he had treated her blessing, with a sort of gentle impatience
as if tired of a fond yet somewhat troublesome
parent. Finally, there is an instinct which serves as resultant
to all the complex forces, emotional or rational, which sway
us between right and wrong; this instinct of conscience is
formally disavowed by Richard:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> iii. 309.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Conscience is but a word that cowards use,</div>
<div class="i0">Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>But he regards
villainy
with the
intellectual
enthusiasm
of the
artist.</em></div>

<p>But, if the natural heat of emotion is wanting, there is, on
the other hand, the full intellectual warmth of an artist's
enthusiasm, whenever Richard turns to survey the game he is
playing. He reflects with a relish how he does the wrong
and first begins the brawl, how he sets secret mischief
abroach and charges it on to others, beweeping his own
victims to simple gulls, and,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii, from 324.</span>when these begin to cry for
vengeance, quoting Scripture against returning evil for evil,
and thus seeming a saint when most he plays the devil. The
great master is known by his appreciation of details, in the
least of which he can see the play of great principles: so the
magnificence of Richard's villainy does not make him insensible
to commonplaces of crime. When in the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>usurpation conspiracy there is a moment's breathing space
just before the Lord Mayor enters,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> vi. 1-11.</span>Richard and Buckingham
utilise it for a burst of hilarity over the deep hypocrisy with
which they are playing their parts; how they can counterfeit
the deep tragedian, murder their breath in the middle of a
word, tremble and start at wagging of a straw:&mdash;here we have
the musician's flourish upon his instrument from very wantonness
of skill. Again:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 118.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so</div>
<div class="i0">That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>is the composer's pleasure at hitting upon a readily workable
theme. Richard appreciates his murderers as a workman
appreciates good tools:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 354.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:</div>
<div class="i0">I like you, lads.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii, from
228.</div>

<p>And at the conclusion of the scene with Lady Anne we have
the artist's enjoyment of his own masterpiece:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?</div>
<div class="i0">Was ever woman in this humour won?...</div>
<div class="i0">What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,</div>
<div class="i0">To take her in her heart's extremest hate,</div>
<div class="i0">With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,</div>
<div class="i0">The bleeding witness of her hatred by;</div>
<div class="i0">Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,</div>
<div class="i0">And I nothing to back my suit at all,</div>
<div class="i0">But the plain devil and dissembling looks,</div>
<div class="i0">And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tone in this passage is of the highest: it is the tone of a
musician fresh from a triumph of his art, the sweetest point
in which has been that he has condescended to no adventitious
aids, no assistance of patronage or concessions to
popular tastes; it has been won by pure music. So the artist
in villainy celebrates a triumph of <em>plain devil</em>!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The
villainy
ideal in success: a
fascination
of irresistibility
in
Richard.</em></div>

<p>This view of Richard as an artist in crime is sufficient to
explain the hold which villainy has on Richard himself: but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>ideal villainy must be ideal also in its success; and on this
side of the analysis another conception in Shakespeare's
portraiture becomes of first importance. It is obvious enough
that Richard has all the elements of success which can be
reduced to the form of skill: but he has something more.
No theory of human action will be complete which does not
recognise a dominion of will over will operating by mere contact,
without further explanation so far as conscious influence
is concerned. What is it that takes the bird into the jaws of
the serpent? No persuasion or other influence on the bird's
consciousness, for it struggles to keep back; we can only
recognise the attraction as a force, and give it a name,
fascination. In Richard there is a similar Fascination of
Irresistibility, which also operates by his mere presence, and
which fights for him in the same way in which the idea of
their invincibility fought for conquerors like Napoleon, and
was on occasions as good to them as an extra twenty or thirty
thousand men. A consideration like this will be appreciated
in the case of <em>tours de force</em> like the Wooing of Lady Anne,
which is a stumblingblock to many readers&mdash;a widow beside
the bier of her murdered husband's murdered father wooed
and won by the man who makes no secret that he is the
murderer of them both. The analysis of ordinary human
motives would make it appear that Anne would not yield at
points at which the scene represents her as yielding; some
other force is wanted to explain her surrender, and it is found
in this secret force of irresistible will which Richard bears about
with him. But, it will be asked, in what does this fascination
appear? The answer is that the idea of it is furnished to us
by the other scenes of the play. Such a consideration illustrates
the distinction between real and ideal. An ideal incident
is not an incident of real life simply clothed in beauty of
expression; nor, on the other hand, is an ideal incident
divorced from the laws of real possibility. Ideal implies that
the transcendental has been made possible by treatment: that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>an incident (for example) which might be impossible in itself
becomes possible through other incidents with which it is associated,
just as in actual life the action of a public personage
which may have appeared strange at the time becomes
intelligible when at his death we can review his life as a
whole. Such a scene as the Wooing Scene might be impossible
as a fragment; it becomes possible enough in the
play, where it has to be taken in connection with the rest of
the plot, throughout which the irresistibility of the hero is
prominent as one of the chief threads of connection.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The fascination
is to
be conveyed
in the
acting.</em></span>Nor is
it any objection that the Wooing Scene comes early in the
action. The play is not the book, but the actor's interpretation
on the stage, and the actor will have collected even from
the latest scenes elements of the interpretation he throws
into the earliest: the actor is a lens for concentrating the
light of the whole play upon every single detail. The fascination
of irresistibility, then, which is to act by instinct in
every scene, may be arrived at analytically when we survey
the play as a whole&mdash;when we see how by Richard's
innate genius, by the reversal in him of the ordinary relation
of human nature to crime, especially by his perfect mastery
of the successive situations as they arise, the dramatist
steadily builds up an irresistibility which becomes
a secret force clinging to Richard's presence, and through
the operation of which his feats are half accomplished by
the fact of his attempting them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The irresistibility
analysed.
Unlikely
means.</em></div>

<p>To begin with: the sense of irresistible power is brought
out by the way in which the unlikeliest things are continually
drawn into his schemes and utilised as means.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i, from
42.</span>Not
to speak of his regular affectation of blunt sincerity, he
makes use of the simple brotherly confidence of Clarence as
an engine of fratricide, <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv; esp.
76 compared
with
<strong>iii.</strong> i. 184.</span>and founds on the frank familiarity
existing between himself and Hastings a plot by
which he brings him to the block. The Queen's compunction
at the thought of leaving Clarence out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>general reconciliation around the dying king's bedside is the
fruit of a conscience tenderer than her neighbours':
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, from
73: cf. 134.</span>Richard
adroitly seizes it as an opportunity for shifting on to the
Queen and her friends the suspicion of the duke's murder.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 154.</span>The childish prattle of little York Richard manages to suggest
to the bystanders as dangerous treason;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 52-72.</span>the solemnity
of the king's deathbed he turns to his own purposes by outdoing
all the rest in Christian forgiveness and humility;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v. 99,
&amp;c.</span>and
he selects devout meditation as the card to play with the
Lord Mayor and citizens. On the other hand, amongst
other devices for the usurpation conspiracy, he starts a
slander upon his own mother's purity;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v. 75-94.</span>and further&mdash;by one
of the greatest strokes in the whole play&mdash;makes capital
in the Wooing Scene out of his own heartlessness,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 156-167.</span>describing
in a burst of startling eloquence the scenes of
horror he has passed through, the only man unmoved to
tears, in order to add:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,</div>
<div class="i0">Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are things which are too sacred for villainy to touch,
and there are things which are protected by their own foulness:
both alike are made useful by Richard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The sensation
produced
by
one crime
made to
bring about
others.</em></div>

<p>Similarly it is to be noticed how Richard can utilise the
very sensation produced by one crime as a means to bring
about more; as when he interrupts the King's dying moments
to announce the death of Clarence in such a connection as
must give a shock to the most unconcerned spectator,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, from
77; cf. 134.</span>and
then draws attention to the pale faces of the Queen's friends
as marks of guilt. He thus makes one crime beget another
without further effort on his part, reversing the natural law
by which each criminal act, through its drawing more suspicion
to the villain, tends to limit his power for further
mischief.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Richard's
own plans
foisted on to
others.</em></span>It is to the same purpose that Richard chooses
sometimes instead of acting himself to foist his own schemes
on to others; as when he inspires Buckingham with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
idea of the young king's arrest, and, when Buckingham
seizes the idea as his own, meekly accepts it from him:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 112-154;
esp.
149.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I, like a child, will go by thy direction.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is in all this a dreadful <em>economy</em> of crime: not the
economy of prudence seeking to reduce its amount, but the
artist's economy which delights in bringing the largest
number of effects out of a single device. Such skill opens
up a vista of evil which is boundless.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>No signs of
effort in
Richard:
imperturbability
of
mind.</em></div>

<p>The sense of irresistible power is again brought out by his
perfect imperturbability of mind: villainy never ruffles his
spirits. He never misses the irony that starts up in the
circumstances around him, and says to Clarence:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 111.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">This deep disgrace in brotherhood</div>
<div class="i0"><em>Touches</em> me deeply.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>While taking his part in entertaining the precocious King
he treats us to continual asides&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 79,
94.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">So wise so young, they say, do never live long&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>showing how he can stop to criticise the scenes in which
he is an actor.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 24.</span>He can delay the conspiracy on which his
chance of the crown depends by coming late to the council,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 32.</span>and then while waiting the moment for turning upon his
victim is cool enough to recollect the Bishop of Ely's strawberries.
<span class="sidenote"><em>humour;</em></span>But more than all these examples is to be noted
Richard's <em>humour</em>. This is <em>par excellence</em> the sign of a
mind at ease with itself: scorn, contempt, bitter jest belong
to the storm of passion, but humour is the sunshine of the
soul. Yet Shakespeare has ventured to endow Richard
with unquestionable humour. <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 151-156.</span>Thus, in one of his earliest
meditations, he prays, 'God take King Edward to his
mercy,' for then he will marry Warwick's youngest daughter:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What though I kill'd her husband and her father!</div>
<div class="i0">The readiest way to make the wench amends</div>
<div class="i0">Is to become her husband and her father!</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">e.g. <strong>i.</strong> i.
118; <strong>ii.</strong> ii. 109; <strong>iv.</strong> iii.
38, 43; <strong>i.</strong>
iii. 142; <strong>ii.</strong>
i. 72; <strong>iii.</strong>
vii. 51-54,
&amp;c.</div>

<p>And all through there perpetually occur little turns of language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
into which the actor can throw a tone of humorous
enjoyment; notably, when he complains of being 'too
childish-foolish for this world,' and where he nearly ruins the
effect of his edifying penitence in the Reconciliation Scene,
by being unable to resist one final stroke:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I thank my God for my humility!</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>freedom
from prejudice.</em></div>

<p>Of a kindred nature is his perfect frankness and fairness to
his victims: villainy never clouds his judgment. Iago,
astutest of intriguers, was deceived, as has been already
noted, by his own morbid acuteness, and firmly believed&mdash;what
the simplest spectator can see to be a delusion&mdash;that
Othello has tampered with his wife. Richard, on the contrary,
is a marvel of judicial impartiality; he speaks of King
Edward in such terms as these&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 36.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If King Edward be as true and just</div>
<div class="i0">As I am subtle, false and treacherous;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and weighs elaborately the superior merit of one of his
victims to his own:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. from
240.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,</div>
<div class="i0">Framed in the prodigality of nature,</div>
<div class="i0">Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,</div>
<div class="i0">The spacious world cannot again afford:</div>
<div class="i0">And will she yet debase her eyes on me,</div>
<div class="i0">That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince,</div>
<div class="i0">And made her widow to a woful bed?</div>
<div class="i0">On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Richard can rise to all his height of villainy without its
leaving on himself the slightest trace of struggle or even
effort.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>A recklessness
suggesting
boundless
resources.</em></div>

<p>Again, the idea of boundless resource is suggested by an
occasional recklessness, almost a slovenliness, in the details
of his intrigues. Thus, in the early part of the Wooing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>Scene he makes two blunders of which a tyro in intrigue
might be ashamed.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 91.</span>He denies that he is the author of Edward's
death, to be instantly confronted with the evidence
of Margaret as an eye-witness. Then a few lines further
on he goes to the opposite extreme:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 101.</div>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">
<em>Anne.</em> Didst thou not kill this king?</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Glouc.</em>
<span class="i6b">I grant ye.</span></div>

<div class="i0"><em>Anne</em>. Dost grant me, hedgehog?</div>
</div>
</div></div>
<p>The merest beginner would know better how to meet
accusations than by such haphazard denials and acknowledgments.
But the crack billiard-player will indulge at
the beginning of the game in a little clumsiness, giving his
adversaries a prospect of victory only to have the pleasure
of making up the disadvantage with one or two brilliant
strokes. And so Richard, essaying the most difficult problem
ever attempted in human intercourse, lets half the interview
pass before he feels it worth while to play with caution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>General
character of
Richard's
intrigue:
inspiration
rather than
calculation.</em></div>

<p>The mysterious irresistibility of Richard, pointed to by
the succession of incidents in the play, is assisted by the
very improbability of some of the more difficult scenes in
which he is an actor. Intrigue in general is a thing of
reason, and its probabilities can be readily analysed; but the
genius of intrigue in Richard seems to make him avoid the
caution of other intriguers, and to give him a preference for
feats which seem impossible. The whole suggests how it is
not by calculation that he works, but he brings the <em>touch</em> of
an artist to his dealing with human weakness, and follows
whither his artist's inspiration leads him. If, then, there is
nothing so remote from evil but Richard can make it tributary;
if he can endow crimes with power of self-multiplying;
if he can pass through a career of sin without the taint
of distortion on his intellect and with the unruffled calmness
of innocence; if Richard accomplishes feats no other would
attempt with a carelessness no other reputation would risk,
even slow reason may well believe him irresistible. When,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>further, such qualifications for villainy become, by unbroken
success in villainy, reflected in Richard's very bearing; when
the only law explaining his motions to onlookers is the lawlessness
of genius whose instinct is more unerring than the
most laborious calculation and planning, it becomes only
natural that the <em>opinion</em> of his irresistibility should become
converted into a mystic <em>fascination</em>, making Richard's very
presence a signal to his adversaries of defeat, chilling with
hopelessness the energies with which they are to face his
consummate skill.</p>

<p>The two main ideas of Shakespeare's portrait, the idea of
an artist in crime and the fascination of invincibility which
Richard bears about with him, are strikingly illustrated in
the wooing of Lady Anne.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii.</span>For a long time Richard will not
put forth effort, but meets the loathing and execration hurled
at him with repartee, saying in so many words that he regards
the scene as a 'keen encounter of our wits.'
<span class="sidenote">115.</span>All this time
the mysterious power of his presence is operating, the more
strongly as Lady Anne sees the most unanswerable cause
that denunciation ever had to put produce no effect upon
her adversary, and feels her own confidence in her wrongs
recoiling upon herself.
<span class="sidenote">from 152.</span>When the spell has had time to
work then he assumes a serious tone: suddenly, as we have
seen, turning the strong point of Anne's attack, his own
inhuman nature, into the basis of his plea&mdash;he who never
wept before has been softened by love to her. From this
point he urges his cause with breathless speed;
<span class="sidenote">175.</span>he presses a
sword into her hand with which to pierce his breast, knowing
that she lacks the nerve to wield it, and seeing how such
forbearance on her part will be a starting-point in giving
way. <span class="sidenote">from 193.</span>We can trace the sinking of her will before the unconquerable
will of her adversary in her feebler and feebler
refusals, while as yet very shame keeps her to an outward
defiance. Then, when she is wishing to yield, he suddenly
finds her an excuse by declaring that all he desires at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>moment is that she should leave the care of the King's
funeral</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">To him that hath more cause to be a mourner.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By yielding this much to penitence and religion we see she
has commenced a downward descent from which she will
never recover. Such consummate art in the handling of
human nature, backed by the spell of an irresistible presence,
the weak Anne has no power to combat.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 66-87.</span>To the last
she is as much lost in amazement as the reader at the way
it has all come about:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</div>
<div class="i0">Even in so short a space, my woman's heart</div>
<div class="i0">Grossly grew captive to his honey words.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ideal</em> v.
<em>real
villainy</em></div>

<p>To gather up our results. A dramatist is to paint a portrait
of ideal villainy as distinct from villainy in real life. In
real life it is a commonplace that a virtuous life is a life of
effort; but the converse is not true, that he who is prepared
to be a villain will therefore lead an easy life. On the contrary,
'the <em>way</em> of transgressors is hard.' The metaphor
suggests a path, laid down at first by the Architect of the
universe, beaten plain and flat by the generations of men
who have since trodden it: he who keeps within this path of
rectitude will walk, not without effort, yet at least with
safety; but he who 'steps aside' to the right or left will
find his way beset with pitfalls and stumblingblocks. In
real life a man sets out to be a villain, but his mental power
is deficient, and he remains a villain only in intention. Or
he has stores of power, but lacks the spark of purpose to set
them aflame. Or, armed with both will to plan and mind to
execute, yet his efforts are hampered by unfit tools. Or, if
his purpose needs reliance alone on his own clear head and
his own strong arm, yet in the critical moment the emotional
nature he has inherited with his humanity starts into
rebellion and scares him, like Macbeth, from the half-accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>deed. Or, if he is as hardened in nature as
corrupt in mind and will, yet he is closely pursued by a
mocking fate, which crowns his well-laid plans with a mysterious
succession of failures. Or, if there is no other
limitation on him from within or from without, yet he may
move in a world too narrow to give him scope: the man
with a heart to be the scourge of his country proves in fact
no more than the vagabond of a country side.&mdash;But in
Shakespeare's portrait we have infinite capacity for mischief,
needing no purpose, for evil has become to it an end in
itself; we have one who for tools can use the baseness of his
own nature or the shame of those who are his nearest kin,
while at his touch all that is holiest becomes transformed
into weapons of iniquity. We have one whose nature in the
past has been a gleaning ground for evil in every stage of
his development, and who in the present is framed to look
on unnatural horror with the eyes of interested curiosity.
We have one who seems to be seconded by fate with a
series of successes, which builds up for him an irresistibility
that is his strongest safeguard; and who, instead of being
cramped by circumstances, has for his stage the world of
history itself, in which crowns are the prize and nations the
victims. In such a portrait is any element wanting to arrive
at the ideal of villainy?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ideal
villainy</em>
v. <em>monstrosity.</em></div>

<p>The question would rather be whether Shakespeare has
not gone too far, and, passing outside the limits of art, exhibited
a monstrosity. Nor is it an answer to point to the
'dramatic hedging' by which Richard is endowed with undaunted
personal courage, unlimited intellectual power, and
every good quality not inconsistent with his perfect villainy.
The objection to such a portrait as the present study presents
is that it offends against our sense of the principles upon which
the universe has been constructed; we feel that before a
violation of nature could attain such proportions nature must
have exerted her recuperative force to crush it. If, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>the dramatist can suggest that such reassertion of nature is
actually made, that the crushing blow is delayed only while
it is accumulating force: in a word, if the dramatist can
draw out before us a <em>Nemesis</em> as ideal as the villainy was
ideal, then the full demands of art will be satisfied. The
Nemesis that dominates the whole play of <em>Richard III</em> will
be the subject of the next study.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Richard III: How Shakespeare weaves
Nemesis into History.</span></p>

<p class="right"><em>A Study in Plot.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Richard
III: from
the Character
side a
violation of
Nemesis;</em></div>

<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> alluded already to the dangerous tendency, which,
as it appears to me, exists amongst ordinary readers of
Shakespeare, to ignore plot as of secondary importance,
and to look for Shakespeare's greatness mainly in his conceptions
of character. But the full character effect of a
dramatic portrait cannot be grasped if it be dissociated from
the plot; and this is nowhere more powerfully illustrated
than in the play of <em>Richard III</em>. The last study was
devoted exclusively to the Character side of the play, and
on this confined view the portrait of Richard seemed a huge
offence against our sense of moral equilibrium, rendering
artistic satisfaction impossible. Such an impression vanishes
when, as in the present study, the drama is looked at from
the side of Plot. <span class="sidenote"><em>from the
side of Plot,
the transformation
of history
into Nemesis.</em></span>The effect of this plot is, however,
missed by those who limit their attention in reviewing it to
Richard himself. These may feel that there is nothing in his
fate to compensate for the spectacle of his crimes: man
must die, and a death in fulness of energy amid the glorious
stir of battle may seem a fate to be envied. But the Shakespearean
Drama with its complexity of plot is not limited
to the individual life and fate in its interpretation of history;
and when we survey all the distinct trains of interest in the
play of <em>Richard III</em>, with their blendings and mutual
influence, we shall obtain a sense of dramatic satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>amply counterbalancing the monstrosity of Richard's villainy.
Viewed as a study in character the play leaves in us only an
intense craving for Nemesis: when we turn to consider the
plot, this presents to us the world of history transformed
into an intricate design of which the recurrent pattern is
Nemesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The underplot:
a set
of separate
Nemesis
Actions.</em></div>

<p>This notion of tracing a pattern in human affairs is a
convenient key to the exposition of plot. Laying aside
for the present the main interest of Richard himself, we may
observe that the bulk of the drama consists in a number of
minor interests&mdash;single threads of the pattern&mdash;each of
which is a separate example of Nemesis.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Clarence.</em></span>The first of these
trains of interest centres around the Duke of Clarence. He has
betrayed the Lancastrians, to whom he had solemnly sworn
fealty, for the sake of the house of York;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 50, 66.</span>this perjury is his
bitterest recollection in his hour of awakened conscience, and
is urged home by the taunts of his murderers; while his only
defence is that he did it all for his brother's love.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 86.</span>Yet his
lot is to fall by a treacherous death, the warrant for which is
signed by this brother, the King and head of the Yorkist house,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 250.</span>while its execution is procured by the bulwark of the house,
the intriguing Richard.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The King.</em></span>The centre of the second nemesis
is the King, who has thus allowed himself in a moment of
suspicion to be made a tool for the murder of his brother,
seeking to stop it when too late.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 77-133.</span>Shakespeare has contrived
that this death of Clarence, announced as it is in
so terrible a manner beside the King's sick bed, gives him a
shock from which he never rallies, and he is carried out to
die with the words on his lips:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O God, I fear Thy justice will take hold</div>
<div class="i0">On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Queen
and her
kindred.</em></div>

<p>In this nemesis on the King are associated the Queen and
her kindred. They have been assenting parties to the
measures against Clarence (however little they may have
contemplated the bloody issue to which those measures have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>been brought by the intrigues of Gloster).
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 62-65.</span>This we must
understand from the introduction of Clarence's children,
who serve no purpose except to taunt the Queen in her
bereavement:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Boy.</em>   Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;</div>
<div class="i2">How can we aid you with our kindred tears?</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Girl.</em>  Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;</div>
<div class="i2">Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 74,
&amp;c.</div>

<p>The death of the King, so unexpectedly linked to that of
Clarence, removes from the Queen and her kindred the sole
bulwark to the hated Woodville family, and leaves them at
the mercy of their enemies.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Hastings.</em></span>A third nemesis Action has
Hastings for its subject.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 66; <strong>iii.</strong>
ii. 58, &amp;c.</span>Hastings is the head of the court-faction
which is opposed to the Queen and her allies, and he
passes all bounds of decency in his exultation at the fate
which overwhelms his adversaries:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But I shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence,</div>
<div class="i0">That they who brought me in my master's hate,</div>
<div class="i0">I live to look upon their tragedy.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He even forgets his dignity as a nobleman, and stops on his
way to the Tower to chat with a mere officer of the court,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 97.</span>in order to tell him the news of which he is full, that his
enemies are to die that day at Pomfret. Yet this very
journey of Hastings is his journey to the block; the same
cruel fate which had descended upon his opponents, from
the same agent and by the same unscrupulous doom, is dealt
out to Hastings in his turn.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Buckingham.</em></span>In this treacherous casting off
of Hastings when he is no longer useful, Buckingham has
been a prime agent.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from

<p>while in the details of the judicial murder he plays second to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>off when he hesitates to go further with Richard's villainous
schemes; <span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii, from

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><em>The four
nemeses
formed into
a system by
nemesis as
a link.</em></div>

<p>These four Nemesis Actions, it will be observed, are not
separate trains of incident going on side by side, they are
linked together into a system, the law of which is seen to be
that those who triumph in one nemesis become the victims
of the next; so that the whole suggests a 'chain of destruction,'
like that binding together the orders of the brute
creation which live by preying upon one another. When
Clarence perished it was the King who dealt the doom and
the Queen's party who triumphed: the wheel of Nemesis goes
round and the King's death follows the death of his victim,
the Queen's kindred are naked to the vengeance of their
enemies, and Hastings is left to exult. Again the wheel of
Nemesis revolves, and Hastings at the moment of his highest
exultation is hurled to destruction, while Buckingham stands
by to point the moral with a gibe. Once more the wheel
goes round, and Buckingham hears similar gibes addressed
to himself and points the same moral in his own person.
Thus the portion of the drama we have so far considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>yields us a pattern within a pattern, a series of Nemesis
Actions woven into a complete underplot by a connecting-link
which is also Nemesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The 'Enveloping
Action' a
nemesis.</em></div>

<p>Following out the same general idea we may proceed to
notice how the dramatic pattern is surrounded by a fringe or
border. The picture of life presented in a play will have the
more reality if it be connected with a life wider than its own.
There is no social sphere, however private, but is to some
extent affected by a wider life outside it, this by one wider
still, until the great world is reached the story of which is
History. The immediate interest may be in a single family,
but it will be a great war which, perhaps, takes away some
member of this family to die in battle, or some great commercial
crisis which brings mutation of fortune to the
obscure home. The artists of fiction are solicitous thus to
suggest connections between lesser and greater; it is the
natural tendency of the mind to pass from the known to the
unknown, and if the artist can derive the movements in his
little world from the great world outside, he appears to have
given his fiction a basis of admitted truth to rest on. This
device of enclosing the incidents of the actual story in a framework
of great events&mdash;technically, the 'Enveloping Action'&mdash;is
one which is common in Shakespeare; it is enough to
instance such a case as <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, in which
play a fairy story has a measure of historic reality given to it
by its connection with the marriage of personages so famous
as Theseus and Hippolyta. In the present case, the main
incidents and personages belong to public life; nevertheless
the effect in question is still secured, and the contest of
factions with which the play is occupied is represented as
making up only a few incidents in the great feud of Lancaster
and York. This Enveloping Action of the whole play,
the War of the Roses, is marked with special clearness: two
personages are introduced for the sole purpose of giving it
prominence.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 80.</span>The Duchess of York is by her years and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>position the representative of the whole house; the factions
who in the play successively triumph and fall are all descended
from herself; she says:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Alas, I am the mother of these moans!</div>
<div class="i0">Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii, from
111; and
<strong>iv.</strong> iv. 1-125.</div>

<p>And probabilities are forced to bring in Queen Margaret,
the head and sole rallying-point of the ruined Lancastrians:
when the two aged women are confronted the whole civil
war is epitomised. It is hardly necessary to point out that
this Enveloping Action is itself a Nemesis Action. All the
rising and falling, the suffering and retaliation that we
actually see going on between the different sections of the
Yorkist house, constitute a detail in a wider retribution:
<span class="sidenote">esp. <strong>ii.</strong> ii;
<strong>iv.</strong> i; <strong>iv.</strong> iv.</span>the
presence of the Duchess gives to the incidents a unity,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii; and
<strong>iv.</strong> iv.</span>Queen
Margaret's function is to point out that this unity of woe is
only the nemesis falling on the house of York for their
wrongs to the house of Lancaster. Thus the pattern made
up of so many reiterations of nemesis is enclosed in a
border which itself repeats the same figure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Enveloping
Nemesis
carried on
into indefiniteness.</em></div>

<p>The effect is carried further. Generally the Enveloping
Action is a sort of curtain by which our view of a drama is
bounded; in the present case the curtain is at one point
lifted, and we get a glimpse into the world beyond. Queen
Margaret has surprised the Yorkist courtiers, and her prophetic
denunciations are still ringing, in which she points to
the calamities her foes have begun to suffer as retribution for
the woes of which her fallen greatness is the representative&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 174-194.</span>when
Gloster suddenly turns the tables upon her.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The curse my noble father laid on thee,</div>
<div class="i0">When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper</div>
<div class="i0">And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,</div>
<div class="i0">And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout</div>
<div class="i0">Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">His curses, then from bitterness of soul</div>
<div class="i0">Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;</div>
<div class="i0">And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>

And the new key-note struck by Gloster is taken up in
chorus by the rest, who find relief from the crushing effect of
Margaret's curses by pressing the charge home upon her.
This is only a detail, but it is enough to carry the effect of
the Enveloping Action a degree further back in time: the
events of the play are nemesis on York for wrongs done to
Lancaster, but now, it seems, these old wrongs against
Lancaster were retribution for yet older crimes Lancaster had
committed against York. As in architecture the vista is
contrived so as to carry the general design of the building
into indefiniteness, so here, while the grand nemesis, of
which Margaret's presence is the representative, shuts in the
play like a veil, the momentary lifting of the veil opens up a
vista of nemeses receding further and further back into
history.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The one
attempt to
reverse the
nemesis
confirms it.</em></div>

<p>Once more. All that we have seen suggests it as a sort
of law to the feud of York and Lancaster that each is
destined to wreak vengeance on the other, and then itself
suffer in turn.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii.</span>But at one notable point of the play an
attempt is made to evade the hereditary nemesis by the
marriage of Richard and Lady Anne. Anne, daughter to
Warwick&mdash;the grand deserter to the Lancastrians and martyr
to their cause&mdash;widow to the murdered heir of the house
and chief mourner to its murdered head, is surely the
greatest sufferer of the Lancastrians at the hands of the
Yorkists. Richard is certainly the chief avenger of York
upon Lancaster. When the chief source of vengeance and
the chief sufferer are united in the closest of all bonds, the
attempt to evade Nemesis becomes ideal. Yet what is the
consequence? This attempt of Lady Anne to evade the
hereditary curse proves the very channel by which the curse
descends upon herself.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 66-87.</span>We see her once more: she is then
on her way to the Tower, and we hear her tell the strange
story of her wooing, and wish the crown were 'red hot steel
to sear her to the brain'; never, she says, since her union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>with Richard has she enjoyed the golden dew of sleep; she is
but waiting for the destruction, by which, no doubt, Richard
will shortly rid himself of her.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>To counteract
the
effect of repetition
the
nemeses are
specially
emphasised:</em></div>

<p>An objection may, however, here present itself, that continual
repetition of an idea like Nemesis, tends to weaken its
artistic effect, until it comes to be taken for granted. No
doubt it is a law of taste that force may be dissipated by
repetition if carried beyond a certain point. But it is to be
noted, on the other hand, what pains Shakespeare has taken
to counteract the tendency in the present instance. The
force of a nemesis may depend upon a fitness that addresses
itself to the spectator's reflection, or it may be measured by
the degree to which the nemesis is brought into prominence
in the incidents themselves.
<span class="sidenote"><em>by recognition,</em></span>In the incidents of the present
play special means are adopted to make the recognition of
the successive nemeses as they arise emphatic. In the first
place the nemesis is in each case pointed out at the moment
of its fulfilment. <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv, from
18.</span>In the case of Clarence his story of crime
and retribution is reflected in his dream before it is brought
to a conclusion in reality; and wherein the bitterness of this
review consists, we see when he turns to his sympathising
jailor and says:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 66.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O Brackenbury, I have done those things,</div>
<div class="i0">Which now bear evidence against my soul,</div>
<div class="i0">For Edward's sake: and see how he requites me!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The words have already been quoted in which the King recognises
how God's justice has overtaken him for his part in
Clarence's death, and those in which the children of Clarence
taunt the Queen with her having herself to bear the bereavement
she has made them suffer. As the Queen's kindred are
being led to their death, one of them exclaims:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 15.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads</div>
<div class="i0">For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hastings, when his doom has wakened him from his infatuation,
recollects a priest he had met on his way to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>Tower, with whom he had stopped to talk about the discomfiture
of his enemies:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 89.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O, now I want the priest that spake to me!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Buckingham on his way to the scaffold apostrophises the
souls of his victims:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i. 7.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If that your moody discontented souls</div>
<div class="i0">Do through the clouds behold this present hour,</div>
<div class="i0">Even for revenge mock my destruction.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iv. 1, 35.</div>
<p>And such individual notes of recognition are collected into a
sort of chorus when Margaret appears the second time to
point out the fulfilment of her curses, and sits down beside
the old Duchess and her daughter-in-law to join in the
'society of sorrow' and 'cloy her' with beholding the revenge
for which she has hungered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>by prophecy,</em></div>

<p>Again, the nemeses have a further emphasis given to
them by prophecy. <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii, from
195.</span>As Queen Margaret's second appearance
is to mark the fulfilment of a general retribution, so her
first appearance denounced it beforehand in the form of
curses. And the effect is carried on in individual prophecies:
the Queen's friends as they suffer foresee that the
turn of the opposite party will come:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 7.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and Hastings prophesies Buckingham's doom:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 109.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is as if the atmosphere cleared for each sufferer with the
approach of death, and they then saw clearly the righteous
plan on which the universe is constructed, and which had
been hidden from them by the dust of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>and especially
by
irony.</em></div>

<p>But there is a third means, more powerful than either recognition
or prophecy, which Shakespeare has employed to
make his Nemesis Actions emphatic. The danger of an effect
becoming tame by repetition he has met by giving to each
train of nemesis a flash of irony at some point of its course.
In the case of Lady Anne we have already seen how the
exact channel Nemesis chooses by which to descend upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>her is the attempt she made to avert it. She had bitterly
cursed her husband's murderer:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 75.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And be thy wife&mdash;if any be so mad&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">As miserable by the life of thee</div>
<div class="i0">As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In spite of this she had yielded to Richard's mysterious
power, and so, as she feels, proved the <em>subject of her own
heart's curse</em>. Again, it was noticed in the preceding study
how the Queen, less hard than the rest in that wicked court,
or perhaps softened by the spectacle of her dying husband,
essayed to reverse, when too late, what had been done
against Clarence;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 134.</span>Gloster skilfully turned this compunction
of conscience into a ground of suspicion on which he traded
to bring all the Queen's friends to the block, and thus a
moment's relenting was made into a means of destruction.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 187,
199, 200,
206.</span>In Clarence's struggle for life, as one after another the
threads of hope snap, as the appeal to law is met by the
King's command, the appeal to heavenly law by the reminder
of his own sin,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 232.</span>he comes to rest for his last and surest
hope upon his powerful brother Gloster&mdash;and the very murderers
catch the irony of the scene:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="i0"><em>Clar.</em> If you be hired for meed, go back again,</div>
<div class="i2">And I will send you to my brother Gloster,</div>
<div class="i2">Who shall reward you better for my life</div>
<div class="i2">Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Sec. Murd.</em> You are deceived, your brother Gloster hates you.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Clar.</em> O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:</div>
<div class="i2">Go you to him from me.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Both.</em>  <span class="i6b">Ay, so we will.</span></div>

<div class="i0"><em>Clar.</em> Tell him, when that our princely father York</div>
<div class="i2">Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,</div>
<div class="i2">And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,</div>
<div class="i2">He little thought of this divided friendship:</div>
<div class="i2">Bid Gloster think of this, and he will weep.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>First Murd.</em> Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Clar.</em> O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>First Murd.</em>  <span class="i6b">Right,</span></div>
<div class="i2">As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:</div>
<div class="i2">'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
<div class="i0"><em>Clar.</em> It cannot be; for when I parted with him,</div>
<div class="i2">He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,</div>
<div class="i2">That he would labour my delivery.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Sec. Murd.</em> Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee</div>
<div class="i2">From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 95.</div>

<p>In the King's case a special incident is introduced into the
scene to point the irony. Before Edward can well realise
the terrible announcement of Clarence's death, the decorum
of the royal chamber is interrupted by Derby, who bursts
in, anxious not to lose the portion of the king's life that yet
remains, in order to beg a pardon for his follower. The
King feels the shock of contrast:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,</div>
<div class="i0">And shall the same give pardon to a slave?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The prerogative of mercy that exists in so extreme a case as
the murder of a 'righteous gentleman,' and is so passionately
sought by Derby for a servant, is denied to the King himself
for the deliverance of his innocent brother.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
41.</span>The nemesis
on Hastings is saturated with irony; he has the simplest
reliance on Richard and on 'his servant Catesby,' who has
come to him as the agent of Richard's treachery; and the
very words of the scene have a double significance that all
see but Hastings himself.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="i0"><em>Hast.</em> I tell thee, Catesby,&mdash;</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Cate.</em>
<span class="i6b">What, my lord?</span></div>

<div class="i0"><em>Hast.</em> Ere a fortnight make me elder</div>
<div class="i2">I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Cate.</em> 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,</div>
<div class="i2">When men are unprepared, and look not for it.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Hast.</em> O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out</div>
<div class="i2">With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do</div>
<div class="i2">With some men else, who think themselves as safe</div>
<div class="i2">As thou and I.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>As the scenes with Margaret constituted a general summary
of the individual prophecies and recognitions,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i.</span>so the Reconciliation
Scene around the King's dying bed may be said to
gather into a sort of summary the irony distributed through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>the play; for the effect of the incident is that the different
parties pray for their own destruction.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 32.</span>In this scene Buckingham
has taken the lead and struck the most solemn notes
in his pledge of amity; <span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i, from
10.</span>when Buckingham comes to die, his
bitterest thought seems to be that the day of his death is All
Souls' Day.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>This is the day</em> that, in King Edward's time,</div>
<div class="i0">I wish'd might fall on me, when I was found</div>

<div class="i0">This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall</div>
<div class="i0">By the false faith of him I trusted most; ...</div>
<div class="i0">That high All-Seer that I dallied with</div>
<div class="i0">Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head</div>
<div class="i0">And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By devices, then, such as these; by the sudden revelation of
a remedy when it is just too late to use it; by the sudden
memory of clear warnings blindly missed; by the spectacle
of a leaning for hope upon that which is known to be ground
for despair; by attempts to retreat or turn aside proving
short cuts to destruction; above all by the sufferer's perception
that he himself has had a chief share in bringing about his
doom:&mdash;by such irony the monotony of Nemesis is relieved,
and fatality becomes flavoured with mockery.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>This multiplication
of
Nemesis
a dramatic
background
for the
villainy of
Richard.</em></div>

<p>Dramatic design, like design which appeals more directly
to the eye, has its perspective: to miss even by a little the
point of view from which it is to be contemplated is enough
to throw the whole into distortion. So readers who are not
careful to watch the harmony between Character and Plot
have often found in the present play nothing but wearisome
repetition. Or, as there is only a step between the sublime
and the ridiculous, this masterpiece of Shakespearean plot
has suggested to them only the idea of Melodrama,&mdash;that
curious product of dramatic feeling without dramatic inventiveness,
with its world in which poetic justice has become
prosaic, in which conspiracy is never so superhumanly secret
but there comes a still more superhuman detection, and however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>successful villainy may be for a moment the spectator
confidently relies on its being eventually disposed of by a
summary 'off with his head.' The point of view thus missed
in the present play is that this network of Nemesis is all
needed to give dramatic reality to the colossal villainy of the
principal figure. When isolated, the character of Richard is
unrealisable from its offence against an innate sense of retribution.
Accordingly Shakespeare projects it into a world
of which, in whatever direction we look, retribution is the sole
visible pattern; in which, as we are carried along by the
movement of the play, the unvarying reiteration of Nemesis
has the effect of <em>giving rhythm to fate</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The motive
force of the
whole play
is another
nemesis:
the Life
and Death
of Richard.</em></div>

<p>What the action of the play has yielded so far to our investigation
has been independent of the central personage:
we have now to connect Richard himself with the plot.
Although the various Nemesis Actions have been carried on
by their own motion and by the force of retribution as a
principle of moral government, yet there is not one of them
which reaches its goal without at some point of its course
receiving an impetus from contact with Richard. Richard
is thus the source of movement to the whole drama, communicating
his own energy through all parts. It is only fitting
that the motive force to this system of nemeses should be
itself a grand Nemesis Action, the <em>Life and Death</em>, or crime
and retribution, <em>of Richard III</em>. The hero's rise has been
sufficiently treated in the preceding study; it remains to trace
his fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The fall of
Richard:
not a shock
but a succession
of
stages.</em></div>

<p>This fall of Richard is constructed on Shakespeare's
favourite plan; its force is measured, not by suddenness and
violence, but by protraction and the perception of distinct
stages&mdash;the crescendo in music as distinguished from the
fortissimo. Such a fall is not a mere passage through the air&mdash;one
shock and then all is over&mdash;but a slipping down the
face of the precipice, with desperate clingings and consciously
increasing impetus: its effect is the one inexhaustible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>emotion of suspense. If we examine the point at which
the fall begins we are reminded that the nemesis on Richard
is different in its type from the others in the play.
<span class="sidenote">
<em>Not a
nemesis of
equality but
of sureness.</em></span>These
are (like that on Shylock) of the <em>equality</em> type, of which the
motto is measure for measure:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 15.</span>and, with his usual exactness,
Shakespeare gives us a turning-point in the precise centre
of the play, where, as the Queen's kindred are being borne
to their death, we get the first recognition that the general
retribution denounced by Margaret has begun to work. But
the turning-point of Richard's fate is reserved till long past
the centre of the play; his is the nemesis of <em>sureness</em>, in
which the blow is delayed that it may accumulate force.
Not that this turning-point is reserved to the very end;
<span class="sidenote"><em>The turning-point:
irony of its
delay.</em></span>the
change of fortune appears just when Richard has <em>committed
himself</em> to his final crime in the usurpation&mdash;the
murder of the children&mdash;the crime from which his most
unscrupulous accomplice has drawn back.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii, from
46.</span>The effect of
this arrangement is to make the numerous crimes which
follow appear to come by necessity; he is 'so far in blood
that sin will pluck on sin'; he is forced to go on heaping up
his villainies with Nemesis full in his view. This turning-point
appears in the simple announcement that 'Dorset has
fled to Richmond.' There is an instantaneous change in
Richard to an attitude of defence, which is maintained to the
end. His first instinct is action: but as soon as we have
heard the rapid scheme of measures&mdash;most of them crimes&mdash;by
which he prepares to meet his dangers, then he can give
himself up to meditation;
<span class="sidenote">from 98.</span>and we now begin to catch the
significance of what has been announced. The name of
Richmond has been just heard for the first time in this play.
But as Richard meditates we learn how Henry VI prophesied
that Richmond should be a king while he was but a
peevish boy. Again, Richard recollects how lately, while
viewing a castle in the west, the mayor, who showed him
over it, mispronounced its name as 'Richmond'&mdash;and he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>started, for a bard of Ireland had told him he should not
live long after he had seen Richmond. Thus the irony that
has given point to all the other retributions in the play is
not wanting in the chief retribution of all: Shakespeare
compensates for so long keeping the grand Nemesis out
of sight by thus representing Richard as gradually realising
that <em>the finger of Nemesis has been pointing at him all his life
and he has never seen it</em>!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Tantalising
mockery
in Richard's
fate.</em></div>

<p>From this point fate never ceases to tantalise and mock
Richard. He engages in his measures of defence, and with
their villainy his spirits begin to recover:</p>

<p>Suddenly the Nemesis appears again with the news that
Ely, the shrewd bishop he dreads most of all men, is with
Richmond, and that Buckingham has raised an army.
Again, his defence is completing, and the wooing of Elizabeth&mdash;his
masterpiece, since it is the second of its kind&mdash;has
been brought to an issue that deserves his surprised exultation:</p>

And now his equanimity begins at last to be disturbed.
<span class="sidenote"><em>His equanimity

the long scene destiny is openly playing with him, giving
him just enough hope to keep the sense of despair warm.
Messenger follows messenger in hot haste: Richmond is on

is telling upon Richard. In this scene he strikes a messenger
before he has time to learn that he brings good tidings.

<p>A little later he becomes nervous, and we have the minute
attention to details of the man who feels that his all depends
upon one cast; he will not sup, but calls for ink and paper
to plan the morrow's fight, he examines carefully as to his
beaver and his armour, selects White Surrey to ride, and at
last calls for wine and <em>confesses</em> a change in himself:</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Climax of
Richard's
fate: significance
of
the apparitions.</em></div>

<p>Then comes night, and with it the full tide of Nemesis.
By the device of the apparitions the long accumulation of
crimes in Richard's rise are made to have each its due representation
in his fall. It matters not that they are only
apparitions. <span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> iii, from
118.</span>Nemesis itself is the ghost of sin: its sting lies
not in the physical force of the blow, but in the close <em>connection</em>
between a sin and its retribution. So Richard's
victims rise from the dead only to secure that the weight of
each several crime shall lie heavy on his soul in the morrow's
doom. This point moreover must not be missed&mdash;that the
climax of his fate comes to Richard in his <em>sleep</em>.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Significance
of
Richard's
sleep.</em></span>The
supreme conception of resistance to Deity is reached when
God is opposed by God's greatest gift, the freedom of the
will. God, so it is reasoned, is omnipotent, but God has
made man omnipotent in setting no bounds to his will; and
God's omnipotence to punish may be met by man's omnipotence
to endure. Such is the ancient conception of Prometheus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>and such are the reasonings Milton has imagined
for his Satan: to whom, though heaven be lost,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">All is not lost, the unconquerable will ...</div>
<div class="i0">And courage never to submit or yield.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But when that strange bundle of greatness and littleness
which makes up man attempts to oppose with such weapons
the Almighty, how is he to provide for those states in which
the will is no longer the governing force in his nature; for
the sickness, in which the mind may have to share the
feebleness of the body, or for the daily suspension of will in
sleep? Richard can to the last preserve his will from faltering.
But, like all the rest of mankind, he must some time
sleep: that which is the refuge of the honest man, when he
may relax the tension of daily care, sleep, is to Richard his
point of weakness, when the safeguard of invincible will can
protect him no longer. It is, then, this weak moment which
a mocking fate chooses for hurling upon Richard the whole
avalanche of his doom; as he starts into the frenzy of his
half-waking soliloquy we see him, as it were, tearing off
layer after layer of artificial reasonings with which the will-struggles
of a lifetime have covered his soul against the touch
of natural remorse. With full waking his will is as strong
as ever: but meanwhile his physical nature has been shattered
to its depths, and it is only the wreck of Richard that
goes to meet his death on Bosworth Field.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Remaining

<p>There is no need to dwell on the further stages of the
fall: to the last the tantalising mockery continues.

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">How Nemesis and Destiny are interwoven
in Macbeth</span>.</p>

<p class="right"><em>A further Study in Plot.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Macbeth as
a study of
subtlety in
Plot.</em></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present study, like the last, is a study in Plot. The
last illustrated Shakespeare's grandeur of conception, how a
single principle is held firm amidst the intricacies of history,
and reiterated in every detail. The present purpose is to give
an example of Shakespeare's <em>subtlety</em>, and to exhibit the
incidents of a play bound together not by one,
<span class="sidenote"><em>Its threefold
action.</em></span>but by three,
distinct threads of connection&mdash;or, if a technical term may
be permitted, three Forms of Dramatic Action&mdash;all working
harmoniously together into a design equally involved and
symmetrical. One of these forms is Nemesis; the other
two are borrowed from the ancient Drama: it thus becomes
necessary to digress for a moment, in order to notice certain
differences between the ancient and modern Drama, and
between the ancient and modern thought of which the Drama
is the expression.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>In the
passage
from
ancient to
modern,
Destiny
changes
into Providence.</em></div>

<p>In the ancient Classical Drama the main moral idea underlying
its action is the idea of Destiny. The ancient world
recognised Deity, but their deities were not supreme in the
universe; Zeus had gained his position by a revolution,
and in his turn was to be overthrown by revolution; there
was thus, in ancient conception, behind Deity a yet higher
force to which Deity itself was subject. The supreme force
of the universe has by a school of modern thought been defined
as a stream of tendency in things not ourselves making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>for righteousness: if we attempt to adapt this formula to the
ideas of antiquity the difficulty will be in finding anything to
substitute for the word 'righteousness.' Sometimes the sum
of forces in the universe did seem, in the conception of the
ancients, to make for righteousness, and Justice became the
highest law. At other times the world seemed to them
governed by a supernatural Jealousy, and human prosperity
was struck down for no reason except that it was prosperity.
In such philosophy as that of Lucretius, again, the tendency
of all things was towards Destruction; while in the handling
of legends such as that of Hippolytus there is a suggestion of
a dark interest to ancient thought in conceiving Evil itself as
an irresistible force. It appears, then, that the ancient mind
had caught the idea of <em>force</em> in the universe, without adding
to it the further idea of a motive by which that force was
guided: <em>blind</em> fate was the governing power over all other
powers. With this simple conception of force as ruling the
world, modern thought has united as a motive righteousness
or law: the transition from ancient to modern thought may
be fairly described by saying that Destiny has become
changed into Providence as the supreme force of the universe.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The change
reflected in
ancient and
modern
Nemesis.</em></span>The change may be well illustrated by comparing the
ancient and modern conception of Nemesis. To ancient
thought Nemesis was simply one phase of Destiny; the story
of Polycrates has been quoted in a former study to illustrate
how Nemesis appeared to the Greek mind as capricious a
deity as Fortune, a force that might at any time, heedless of
desert, check whatever happiness was high enough to attract
its attention. But in modern ideas Nemesis and justice are
strictly associated: Nemesis may be defined as the artistic
side of justice.</p>

<p>So far as Nemesis then is concerned, it has, in modern
thought, passed altogether out of the domain of Destiny and
been absorbed into the domain of law: it is thus fitted to be
one of the regular forms into which human history may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>represented as falling, in harmony with our modern moral
conceptions. But even as regards Destiny itself, while the
notion as a whole is out of harmony with the modern notion
of law and Providence as ruling forces of the world, yet
certain minor phases of Destiny as conceived by antiquity
have survived into modern times and been found not irreconcilable
with moral law. <span class="sidenote"><em>Nemesis
and Destiny
interwoven
in the plot
of Macbeth</em>.</span>Two of these minor phases of
Destiny are, it will be shown, illustrated in <em>Macbeth</em>: and
we may thus take as a general description of its plot, the
interweaving of Destiny with Nemesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The whole
plot a
Nemesis
Action,</em></div>

<p>That the career of Macbeth is an example of Nemesis
needs only to be stated. As in the case of <em>Richard III</em>, we
have the rise and fall of a leading personage; the rise is a
crime of which the fall is the retribution. Nemesis has just
been defined as the artistic aspect of justice; we have in
previous studies seen different artistic elements in different
types of Nemesis. Sometimes, as with Richard III, the
retribution becomes artistic through its sureness; its long
delay renders the effect of the blow more striking when it
does come. <span class="sidenote"><em>of the type
of equality.</em></span>More commonly the artistic element in Nemesis
consists in the perfect equality between the sin and its retribution;
and of the latter type the Nemesis in the play of
<em>Macbeth</em> is perhaps the most conspicuous illustration. The
rise and fall of Macbeth, to borrow the illustration of
Gervinus, constitute a perfect arch, with a turning-point in
the centre. Macbeth's series of successes is unbroken till it
ends in the murder of Banquo; his series of failures is unbroken
from its commencement in the escape of Fleance.
Success thus constituting the first half and failure the second
half of the play, the transition from the one to the other is
the expedition against Banquo and Fleance, in which success
and failure are mingled:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii.</span>and this expedition, the keystone to
the arch, is found to occupy the exact middle of the middle
Act.</p>

<p>But this is not all: not only the play as a whole is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>example of nemesis, but if its two halves be taken separately
they will be found to constitute each a nemesis complete
in itself. <span class="sidenote"><em>The rise of
Macbeth a
separate
Nemesis
action.</em></span>To begin with the first half, that which is
occupied with the rise of Macbeth. If the plan of the play
extended no further than to make the hero's fall the retribution
upon his rise, it might be expected that the turning-point
of the action would be reached upon Macbeth's
elevation to the throne. As a fact, however, Macbeth's rise
does not stop here; he still goes on to win one more success
in his attempt upon the life of Banquo. What the purpose of
this prolonged flow of fortune is will be seen when it is considered
that this final success of the hero is in reality the
source of his ruin. In Macbeth's progress to the attainment
of the crown, while of course it was impossible that crimes so
violent as his should not incur suspicion, yet circumstances
had strangely combined to soothe these suspicions to sleep.
But&mdash;so Shakespeare manipulates the story&mdash;when Macbeth,
seated on the throne, goes on to the attempt against Banquo,
this additional crime not only brings its own punishment, but
has the further effect of unmasking the crimes that have gone
before. This important point in the plot is brought out to us
in a scene, specially introduced for the purpose, in which
Lennox and another lord represent the opinion of the
court.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> vi. i.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Lennox.</em> My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</div>
<div class="i2">Which can interpret further: only, I say,</div>
<div class="i2">Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan</div>
<div class="i2">Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</div>
<div class="i2">And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;</div>
<div class="i2">Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,</div>
<div class="i2">For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.</div>
<div class="i2">Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</div>
<div class="i2">It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</div>
<div class="i2">To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</div>
<div class="i2">How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight</div>
<div class="i2">In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</div>
<div class="i2">That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
<div class="i2">Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</div>
<div class="i2">For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</div>
<div class="i2">To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,</div>
<div class="i2">He has borne all things well: and I do think</div>
<div class="i2">That had he Duncan's sons under his key&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">As, an't please heaven, he shall not&mdash;they should find</div>
<div class="i2">What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Under the bitter irony of this speech we can see clearly
enough that Macbeth has been exposed by his <em>series</em> of
suspicious acts; he has 'done all things well;' and in
particular by peculiar resemblances between this last incident
of Banquo and Fleance and the previous incident of Duncan
and his son. It appears then that Macbeth's last successful
crime proves the means by which retribution overtakes all his
other crimes; the latter half of the play is needed to develop
the steps of the retribution, but, in substance, Macbeth's fall
is latent in the final step of his rise. Thus the first half of
the play, that which traces the rise of Macbeth, is a complete
Nemesis Action&mdash;a career of sins in which the last sin secures
the punishment of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The fall of Macbeth a separate Nemesis Action.</em></div>

<p>The same reasoning applies to the latter half of the play:
the fall of Macbeth not only serves as the retribution for his
rise, but further contains in itself a crime and its nemesis
complete. What Banquo is to the first half of the play
Macduff is to the latter half; the two balance one another as,
in the play of <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, Cæsar himself is balanced by
Antony; and Macduff comes into prominence upon Banquo's
death as Antony upon the fall of Cæsar. Now Macduff, when
he finally slays Macbeth, is avenging not only Scotland, but
also his own wrongs; and the tyrant's crime against Macduff,
with its retribution, just gives unity to the second half of the
play, in the way in which the first half was made complete by
the association between Macbeth and Banquo,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 57-72.</span>from their joint
encounter with the Witches on to the murder of Banquo as
a consequence of the Witches' prediction. Accordingly we
find that no sooner has Macbeth, by the appearance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>Ghost at the banquet, realised the turn of fate, than his first
thoughts are of Macduff:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 128.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="i0"><em>Macbeth.</em> How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person</div>
<div class="i2">At our great bidding?</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Lady M.</em>   <span class="i6b">Did you send to him, sir?</span></div>

<div class="i0"><em>Macbeth.</em> I hear it by the way; but I will send.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>When the Apparitions bid Macbeth 'beware Macduff,' he
answers,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 74.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thou hast harp'd my fear aright!</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i, from
139.</div>
<p>On the vanishing of the Apparition Scene, the first thing that
happens is the arrival of news that Macduff has fled to
England, and is out of his enemy's power; then Macbeth's
bloody thoughts devise a still more cruel purpose of vengeance
to be taken on the fugitive's family.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:</div>
<div class="i0">The flighty purpose never is o'ertook</div>
<div class="i0">Unless the deed go with it....</div>
<div class="i0">The castle of Macduff I will surprise;</div>
<div class="i0">Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword</div>
<div class="i0">His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls</div>
<div class="i0">That trace him in his line.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii, iii.</div>
<p>In succeeding scenes we have this diabolical massacre carried
out, and see the effect which the news of it has in rousing
Macduff to his revenge;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> vii. 15.</span>until in the final scene of all he feels
that if Macbeth is slain and by no stroke of his, his wife and
children's ghosts will for ever haunt him. Thus Macduff's
function in the play is to be the agent not only of the grand
nemesis which constitutes the whole plot, but also of a
nemesis upon a private wrong which occupies the latter half
of the play. And, putting our results together, we find that
a Nemesis Action is the description alike of the whole plot
and of the rise and fall which are its two halves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Oracular
as one
phase of
Destiny:
its partial
revelation.</em></div>

<p>With Nemesis is associated in the play of <em>Macbeth</em> Destiny
in two distinct phases. The first of these is <em>the Oracular</em>. In
ancient thought, as Destiny was the supreme governor of the
universe, so oracles were the revelation of Destiny; and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>the term 'the Oracles of God' is appropriately applied to the
Bible as the Christian revelation. With the advent of
Christianity the oracles became dumb. But the triumph of
Christianity was for centuries incomplete; heathen deities
were not extirpated, but subordinated to the supernatural
personages of the new religion; <span class="sidenote"><em>A minor
form of the
Oracular
in modern
oracular
beings.</em></span>and the old oracles declined
into oracular beings such as witches and wizards, and
oracular superstitions, such as magic mirrors, dreams, apparitions&mdash;all
means of dimly revealing hidden destiny. Shakespeare
is never wiser than the age he is pourtraying; and
accordingly he has freely introduced witches and apparitions
into the machinery of <em>Macbeth</em>, though in the principles that
govern the action of this, as of all his other plays, he is true
to the modern notions of Providence and moral law.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The Oracular
Action:
Destiny
working
from
mystery to
clearness;</em></span>An oracle and its fulfilment make up a series of events eminently
fitted to constitute a dramatic interest; and no form of
ancient Drama and Story is more common than this of the
'Oracular Action.' Its interest may be formulated as Destiny
working from mystery to clearness. At the commencement
of an oracular story the fated future is revealed indeed, but
in a dress of mystery, as when the Athenians are bidden to
defend themselves with only wooden walls; but as the story
of Themistocles develops itself, the drift of events is throwing
more and more light on to the hidden meaning of the oracle,
until by the naval victory over the Persians the oracle is at
once clear and fulfilled.</p>

<p>The Oracular Action is so important an element in plot,
that it may be worth while to prolong the consideration of it
by noting the three principal varieties into which it falls, all
of which are illustrated in the play of <em>Macbeth</em>. In each case
the interest consists in tracing the working of Destiny out of
mystery into clearness: the distinction between the varieties
depends upon the agency by which Destiny works, and the
relation of this agency to the original oracle. <span class="sidenote">(1) <em>by the
agency of
blind obedience;</em></span>In the first
variety Destiny is fulfilled by the agency of blind obedience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>The Spartans, unfortunate in their war with the Messenians,
enquire of an oracle, and receive the strange response that
they must apply for a general to the Athenians, their hereditary
enemies. But they resolve to obey the voice of Destiny,
though to all appearance they obey at their peril; and the
Athenians mock them by selecting the most unfit subject
they can find&mdash;a man whose bodily infirmities had excluded
him from the military exercises altogether. Yet in the end
the faith of the Spartans is rewarded. It had been no lack
of generalship that had caused their former defeats, but discord
and faction in their ranks; now Tyrtæus turned out to
be a lyric poet, whose songs roused the spirit of the Spartans
and united them as one man, and when united, their native
military talent led them to victory. Thus in its fulfilment the
hidden meaning of the oracle breaks out into clearness:
and blind obedience to the oracle is the agency by which it
has been fulfilled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2) <em>by the
agency of
free will;</em></div>

<p>In the second variety the oracle is fulfilled by the agency
of indifference and free will: it is neither obeyed nor disobeyed,
but ignored. One of the best illustrations is to be
found in the plot of Sir Walter Scott's novel, <em>The Betrothed</em>.
Its heroine, more rational than her age, resists the family
tradition that would condemn her to sleep in the haunted
chamber; overborne, however, by age and authority, she
consents, and the lady of the bloody finger appears to pronounce
her doom:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Widow'd wife, and wedded maid;</div>
<div class="i0">Betrothed, Betrayer, and Betrayed.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This seems a mysterious destiny for a simple and virtuous
girl. The faithful attendant Rose declares in a burst of devotion
that betrayed her mistress may be, but betrayer never; the
heroine herself braces her will to dismiss the foreboding from
her thoughts, and resolves that she will not be influenced by
it on the one side or on the other. Yet it all comes about.
Gratitude compels her to give her hand to the elderly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>Constable, who on the very day of betrothal is summoned
away to the Crusade, from which, as it appears, he is never to
return, leaving his spouse at once a widowed wife and a
wedded maid. In the troubles of that long absence, by a
perfectly natural series of events, gratitude again leads the
heroine to admit to her castle her real deliverer and lover in
order to save his life, and in protecting him amidst strange
circumstances of suspicion to bid defiance to all comers.
Finally the castle is besieged by the royal armies, and the
heroine has to hear herself proclaimed a traitor by the herald
of England; from this perplexity a deliverance is found only
when her best friend saves her by betraying the castle to the
king. So every detail in the unnatural doom has been in the
most natural manner fulfilled: and the woman by whose
action it has been fulfilled has been all the while maintaining
the freedom of her will and persistently ignoring the oracle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3) <em>by the
agency of
opposing
will.</em></div>

<p>But the supreme interest of the Oracular Action is reached
when the oracle is fulfilled by an agency that has all the
while set itself to oppose and frustrate it. A simple illustration
of this is seen in the Eastern potentate who, in opposition
to a prophecy that his son should be killed by a lion, forbad
the son to hunt, but heaped upon him every other indulgence.
In particular he built him a pleasure-house, hung with
pictures of hunting and of wild beasts, on which all that art
could do was lavished to compensate for the loss of the forbidden
sport. One day the son, chafing at his absence from
the manly exercise in which his comrades were at that
moment engaged, wandered through his pleasure-house, until,
stopping at a magnificent picture of a lion at bay, he began
to apostrophise it as the source of his disgrace, and waxing
still more angry, drove his fist through the picture. A nail,
hidden behind the canvas entered his hand; the wound
festered, and he died. So the measures taken to frustrate the
destiny proved the means of fulfilling it. But in this third
variety of the Oracular Action the classical illustration is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>story of &OElig;dipus: told fully, it presents three examples woven
together. Laius of Thebes learns from an oracle that the son
about to be born to him is destined to be his murderer;
accordingly he refuses to rear the child, and it is cast out to
perish. A herdsman, Polybus, takes pity on the infant,
carries it away to Corinth, and brings it up in secret. In due
time this &OElig;dipus becomes weary of the humble life of his
supposed father; quitting Corinth, he seeks advice of the
oracle as to his future career, and receives the startling
response that he is destined to slay his own father. Resolved
to frustrate so terrible a fate, he will not return to Corinth,
but, as it happens, <em>takes the road to Thebes</em>, where he falls in
accidentally with Laius, and, in ignorance of his person,
quarrels with him and slays him. Now if Laius had not
resisted the oracle by casting out the infant, it would have
grown up like other sons, and every probability would have
been against his committing so terrible a crime as parricide.
Again, if Polybus had not by his removal to Corinth sought
to keep the child in ignorance of his fate, he would have
known the person of Laius and spared him. Once more, if
&OElig;dipus had not, in opposition to the oracle, avoided his
supposed home, Corinth, he would never have gone to
Thebes and fallen in with his real father. Three different
persons acting separately seek to frustrate a declared destiny,
and their action unites in fulfilling it.</p>

<p>The plot of <em>Macbeth</em>, both as a whole and in its separate
parts, is constructed upon this form of the Oracular Action,
in combination with the form of Nemesis. The play deals
with the rise and fall of Macbeth: the rise, and the fall, and
again the two taken together, present each of them an
example of an Oracular Action. <span class="sidenote"><em>The rise of
Macbeth an
Oracular
Action,</em></span>Firstly, the former half of
the play, the rise of Macbeth, taken by itself, consists in an
oracle and its fulfilment&mdash;the Witches' promise of the crown
and the gradual steps by which the crown is attained.
Amongst the three varieties of the Oracular Action we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>just distinguished, the present example wavers between the
first and the second. <span class="sidenote"><em>varying between
the
second and
first type.</em></span>After his first excitement has passed
away, Macbeth resolves that he will have nothing to do with
the temptation that lurked in the Witches' words; in his
disjointed meditation we hear him saying:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 143.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If chance will have me king, why chance may crown me</div>
<div class="i0">Without my stir;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and again:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 146.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i7">Come what come may,</div>
<div class="i0">Time and the hour runs through the roughest day;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>in which last speech the very rhyming may, according to
Shakespeare's subtle usage, be pointed to as marking a mind
made up. So far then we appear to be following an Oracular
Action of the second type, that of indifference and ignoring.
But in the very next scene the proclamation of a Prince of
Cumberland&mdash;that is, of an heir-apparent like our Prince of
Wales&mdash;takes away Macbeth's 'chance':</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 48.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Macb.</em> [<em>Aside</em>]. The prince of Cumberland! that is a step</div>
<div class="i2">On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,</div>
<div class="i2">For in my way it lies.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He instantly commits himself to the evil suggestion, and thus
changes the type of action to the first variety, that in which
the oracle is fulfilled by the agency of obedience.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The fall an
Oracular
Action of
the first type.</em></div>

<p>Similarly Macbeth's fall, taken by itself, constitutes an
Oracular Action, consisting as it does of the ironical promises
by the Apparitions which the Witches raise for Macbeth
on his visit to them, and the course of events by which these
promises are fulfilled. Its type is a highly interesting
example of the first variety, that of blind obedience.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 71-100.</span>The
responses of the Apparitions lay down impossible conditions,
and as long as these conditions are unfulfilled Macbeth is to
be secure; he will fall only when one not born of woman
shall be his adversary, only when Birnam Wood shall come
to Dunsinane. Macbeth trusts blindly to these promises;
further he obeys them, so far as a man can be said to obey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>an oracle which enjoins no command: he obeys in the sense
of relying on them, and making that reliance his ground of
action. But this reliance of Macbeth on the ironical
promises is an agency in fulfilling them in their real meaning.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 144-156.</span>In his reckless confidence he strikes out right and left,
and amongst others injures one to whom the description
'not born of woman' applies. In his reliance on the
Apparitions he proceeds, when threatened by the English, to
<em>shut himself up in Dunsinane Castle</em>; but for this fact the
English army would not have approached Dunsinane Castle
by the route of Birnam Wood, and the incident of the boughs
would never have taken place. Thus Macbeth's fate was
made to depend upon impossibilities: by his action in
reliance on these impossibilities he is all the while giving
them occasion to become possible. In this way an ironical
oracle comes to be fulfilled by the agency of blind obedience.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The whole
plot an
Oracular
Action of
the third
type.</em></div>

<p>Thirdly, the rise and fall of Macbeth are so linked together
as to constitute the whole plot another example of the
Oracular Action. <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 48-50,
62-66.</span>The original oracle given by the Witches
on the blasted heath was a double oracle: besides the promise
of the thaneships and the crown there was another revelation
of destiny, that Banquo was to be lesser than Macbeth and
yet greater, that he was to get kings though to be none. In
this latter half of the oracle is found the link which binds
together the rise and fall of Macbeth. When the first half
of the Witches' promise has been fulfilled in his elevation to
the throne, Macbeth sets himself to prevent the fulfilment of
the second half by his attempt upon Banquo and Fleance.
Now we have already seen how this attempt has the effect of
drawing attention, not only to itself, but also to Macbeth's
other crimes, and proves indeed the foundation of his ruin.
Had Macbeth been content with the attainment of the crown,
all might yet have been well: the addition of just one more
precaution renders all the rest vain. It appears, then, that that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>which binds together the rise and the fall, that which makes
the fall the retribution upon the rise, is the expedition against
the Banquo family; and the object of this crime is to
frustrate the second part of the Witches' oracle. So the
original oracle becomes the motive force to the whole play,
setting in motion alike the rise and fall of the action. The
figure of the whole plot we have taken as a regular arch; its
movement might be compared to that terrible incident of
mining life known as 'overwinding,' in which the steam engine
pulls the heavy cage from the bottom to the top of the shaft,
but, instead of stopping then, winds on till the cage is carried
over the pulley and dashed down again to the bottom. So
the force of the Witches' prediction is not exhausted when it
has tempted Macbeth on to the throne, but carries him on to
resist its further clauses, and in resisting to bring about the
fall by which they are fulfilled. Not only then are the rise
and the fall of Macbeth taken separately oracular, but the whole
plot, compounded of the two taken together, constitutes
another Oracular Action; and the last is of that type in which
Destiny is fulfilled by the agency of a will that has been
opposing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Irony a
phase of
malignant
Destiny.</em></div>

<p>A second phase of Destiny enters into the plot of <em>Macbeth</em>:
this is Irony. Etymologically the word means no more than
<em>saying</em>. Pressing the idea of saying as distinguished from
meaning we get at the ordinary signification, ambiguous
speech; from which the word widens in its usage to include
double-dealing in general, such as the 'irony of Socrates,'
his habit of assuming the part of a simple enquirer in order
to entangle the pretentious sophists in their own wisdom.
The particular extension of meaning with which we are
immediately concerned is that by which irony comes to be
applied to a double-dealing in Destiny itself; the link between
this and the original sense being no doubt the ambiguous
wording of oracular responses which has become proverbial.
In ancient conception Destiny wavered between justice and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>malignity; a leading phase of malignant destiny was this
Irony or double-dealing; Irony was the laughter or mockery
of Fate. It is illustrated in the angry measures of &OElig;dipus for
penetrating the mystery that surrounds the murder of Laius
in order to punish the crime, impunity for which has
brought the plague upon his city: when at last it is made
clear that &OElig;dipus himself has been unknowingly the culprit,
there arises an irresistible sensation that Destiny has been all
the while playing with the king, and using his zeal as a
means for working his destruction. In modern thought the
supreme force of the universe cannot possibly be represented
as malignant. <span class="sidenote"><em>A modified
Irony: Justice
in a
mocking
humour.</em></span>But mockery, though it may not be enthroned
in opposition to justice, may yet, without violating modern
ideas, be made to appear in the <em>mode of operation</em> by which
justice is brought about; here mockery is no longer malignant,
but simply an index of overpowering force, just as we
smile at the helpless stubbornness of a little child, whereas a
man's opposition makes us angry. For such a reconciliation
of mockery with righteousness we have authority in the
imagery of Scripture.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Why do the heathen rage?</div>
<div class="i2">And the people imagine a vain thing?</div>
<div class="i0">The kings of the earth set themselves</div>
<div class="i2">And the rulers take counsel together</div>
<div class="i0">Against the Lord</div>
<div class="i2">And against His Anointed:</div>
<div class="i0">Saying, Let us break their bonds,</div>
<div class="i2">And cast away their cords from us.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath;</div>
<div class="i2">And vex them in his sore displeasure.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>There could not be a more perfect type of Irony, in that
form of it which harmonises with justice, than this picture
in three touches, of the busy security of the wicked,
of justice pausing to mock their idle efforts, and then with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>burst of wrath and displeasure annihilating their projects at
a stroke.</p>

<p>In modern thought, then, Irony is Justice in a mocking
humour. The mockery that suddenly becomes apparent in
the mysterious operations of Providence, and is a measure of
their overpowering force, is clearly capable of giving a highly
dramatic interest to a train of events, and so is fitted to be a
form of dramatic action. <span class="sidenote"><em>Irony in
the plot of
Macbeth:
obstacles
converted
into stepping-stones.</em></span>The operation of Destiny as
exhibited in the plot of <em>Macbeth</em> is throughout tinctured with
irony: the element of mockery appearing always in this, that
apparent checks to Destiny turn out the very means Destiny
chooses by which to fulfil itself. Irony of this kind is
regularly attached to what I have called the third variety of
the Oracular Action, that in which the oracle is fulfilled by the
agency of attempts to oppose it; but in the play under
consideration the destiny, whether manifesting itself in that
type of the Oracular Action or not, is never dissociated from
the attitude of mockery to resistance which converts
obstacles into stepping-stones. It remains to show how
the rise of Macbeth, the fall of Macbeth, and again the
rise and the fall taken together, are all of them Irony
Actions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The rise of
Macbeth an
Irony
Action.</em></div>

<p>The basis of Macbeth's rise is the Witches' promise of the
crown. Scarcely has it been given when an obstacle starts
up to its fulfilment in the proclamation of Malcolm as heir-apparent.
I have already pointed out that it is this very
proclamation which puts an end to Macbeth's wavering, and
leads him to undertake the treasonable enterprise which only
in the previous scene he had resolved he would have nothing
to do with. Later in the history a second obstacle appears:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 141.</span>the king is slain, but his two sons, this heir-apparent and
his brother, escape from Macbeth's clutches and place two
lives between him and the fulfilment of his destiny. But, as
events turn out, it is this very flight of the princes that, by
diverting suspicion to them for a moment, causes Macbeth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>be named as Duncan's successor. A conversation in the play
itself is devoted to making this point clear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 22.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="i0"><em>Ross.</em> Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Macduff.</em> Those that Macbeth hath slain.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Ross.</em> <span class="i6b">Alas, the day!</span></div>
<div class="i2">What good could they pretend?</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Macduff.</em>  <span class="i6b">They were suborn'd:</span></div>

<div class="i2">To be invested.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><em>The fall an
Irony
Action.</em></div>

<p>Twice, then, in the course of the rise Destiny allows
obstacles to appear only for the sake of using them as an
unexpected means of fulfilment. The same mockery marks
the fall of the action. The security against a fall promised
by the Apparitions to Macbeth had just one drawback&mdash;'beware
Macduff';
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 71.</span>
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii, &amp;c.</span>and we have already had occasion to
notice Macbeth's attempt to secure himself against this
drawback in the completest manner by extirpating the
dangerous thane and his family to the last scion of his stock,
and also how this cruel purpose succeeded against all but
Macduff himself. Now it is to be noted that this attempt
against the fulfilment of the destined retribution proves the
very source of the fulfilment, without which it would never
have come about. For at one point of the story Macduff,
the only man who, according to the decrees of Fate, can
harm Macbeth, resolves to abandon his vengeance against
him. In his over-cautious policy Macduff was unwilling to
move without the concurrence of Malcolm the rightful heir.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii.</span>In one of the most singular scenes in all Shakespeare
Macduff is represented as urging Malcolm to assert his
rights, while Malcolm (in reality driven by the general panic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>to suspect even Macduff) discourages his attempts, and
affects to be a monster of iniquity, surpassing the tyrant of
Scotland himself. <span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii, from
100.</span>At last he succeeds in convincing Macduff
of his villainies, and in a burst of despair the fate-appointed
avenger renounces vengeance.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Macduff.</em> <span class="i6b">Fit to govern?</span></div>

<div class="i2">Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast</div>
<div class="i2">Thy hope ends here!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Malcolm, it is true, then drops the pretence of villainy, but
he does not succeed in reassuring his companion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 138.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Macduff.</em> Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</div>
<div class="i2">'Tis hard to reconcile.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At this moment enters Ross with the news of Macbeth's
expedition against Fife, and tells how all Macduff's household,
'wife, children, servants, all,' have been cut off 'at
one swoop': before the agony of a bereavement like this
hesitation flies away for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 231.</div>
<div class="center">

<div class="i0">Within my sword's length set him: if he 'scape,</div>
<div class="i0">Heaven forgive him too!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The action taken by Macbeth with a view to prevent Macduff's
being the instrument of retribution, is brought by a
mocking Fate to impel Macduff to his task at the precise
moment he had resolved to abandon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The plot as
a whole an
Irony
Action.</em></div>

<p>Finally, if the rise and the fall be contemplated together
as constituting one action, this also will be found animated
by the same spirit of irony. The original promise of the
Witches, as well as the later promise of the Apparition,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 62-66.</span>had
its drawback in the destiny that Banquo was to be lesser
than Macbeth and yet greater, to get kings though to be
none; and to secure against this drawback is Macbeth's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>purpose in his plot against Banquo and Fleance, by which
the rival family would be extirpated. The plot only <em>half
succeeds</em>, and by its half-success contributes to the exactness
with which the destiny is fulfilled. Had Macbeth's attempt
fully succeeded, Banquo would neither have got kings nor
been one; had no such attempt at all been made, then, for
anything we see to the contrary in the play, Banquo would
have preceded his sons on the throne, and so again the
oracle would not have been fulfilled which made Banquo
lesser than Macbeth. But by the mixture of success and
failure in Macbeth's plot Banquo is slain before he can attain
the crown, and Fleance lives to give a royal house to Scotland.
Once more, then, mockery appears a characteristic of
the Destiny that finds in human resistance just the one
peculiar device needed for effecting the peculiar distribution
of fortune it has promised.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Summary.</em></div>

<p>Such is the subtlety with which Shakespeare has constructed
this plot of <em>Macbeth</em>, and interwoven in it Nemesis
and Destiny. To outward appearance it is connected with
the rise and fall of a sinner: the analysis that searches for
inner principles of construction traces through its incidents
three forms of action working harmoniously together, by
which the rise and fall of Macbeth are so linked as to exhibit
at once a crime with its Nemesis, an Oracle with its fulfilment,
and the Irony which works by the agency of that which
resists it. Again the separate halves of the play, the rise and
the fall of the hero, are found to present each the same triple
pattern as the whole. Once more, with the career of
Macbeth are associated the careers of Banquo and Macduff,
and these also reflect the threefold spirit. Macbeth's rise
involves Banquo's fall: this fall is the subject of oracular
prediction, it is the starting-point of nemesis on Macbeth,
and it has an element of irony in the fact that Banquo <em>all but</em>
escaped. With Macbeth's fall is bound up Macduff's rise:
this also had been predicted in oracles, it is an agency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>in the main nemesis, and Macduff's fate has the irony that
he <em>all but</em> perished at the outset of his mission. Through all
the separate interests of this elaborate plot, the three forms
of action&mdash;Nemesis, the Oracular, Irony&mdash;are seen perfectly
harmonised and perfectly complete. And over all this is
thrown the supernatural interest of the Witches, who are
agents of nemesis working by the means of ironical oracles.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Macbeth, Lord and Lady.</span></p>

<p class="right"><em>A Study in Character-Contrast.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contrasts</span> of character form one of the simplest elements
of dramatic interest. Such contrasts are often obvious; at
other times they take definitiveness only when looked at
from a particular point of view. The contrast of character
which it is the object of the present study to sketch rests
upon a certain distinction which is one of the fundamental
ideas in the analysis of human nature&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><em>The antithesis
of the
outer and
inner life.</em></span>the distinction
between the outer life of action and the inner life of our
own experience. The recognition of the two is as old as
the <em>Book of Proverbs</em>, which contrasts the man that ruleth
his spirit with the man that taketh a city. The heathen
oracle, again, opened out to an age which seemed to have
exhausted knowledge a new world for investigation in the
simple command, Know thyself. The Stoics, who so despised
the busy vanity of state cares, yet delighted to call
their ideal man a king; and their particular tenet is universalised
by Milton when he says:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Therein stands the office of a king,</div>
<div class="i0">His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise,</div>
<div class="i0">That for the public all this weight he bears:</div>
<div class="i0">Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules</div>
<div class="i0">Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the modern humourist finds the idea indispensable for
his pourtrayal of character and experience. 'Sir,' says one of
Thackeray's personages, 'a distinct universe walks about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>under your hat and under mine ... You and I are but a pair
of infinite isolations with some fellow-islands more or less
near to us.' And elsewhere the same writer says that 'each
creature born has a little kingdom of thought of his own,
which it is a sin in us to invade.'</p>

<p>This antithesis of the practical and inner life is so accepted
a commonplace of the pulpit and of the essayist on
morals and culture that it may seem tedious to expound it.
But for the very reason that it belongs to all these spheres,
and that these spheres overlap, the two sides of the antithesis
are not kept clearly distinct, nor are the terms
uniformly used in the same sense. For the present purpose
the exact distinction is between the outer world, the world of
practical action, the sphere of making and doing, in which
we mingle with our fellow men, join in their enterprises, and
influence them to our ideas, in which we investigate nature
and society, or seek to build up a fabric of power: and, on
the other hand, the inner intellectual life, in which our
powers as by a mirror are turned inwards upon ourselves,
finding a field for enterprise in self-discipline and the contest
with inherited notions and passions, exploring the depths of
our consciousness and our mysterious relations with the
unseen, until the thinker becomes familiar with strange situations
of the mind and at ease in the presence of its problems.
The antithesis is thus not at all the same as that between
worldly and religious, for the inner life may be cultivated
for evil: self-anatomy, as Shelley says,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i7">Shall teach the will</div>
<div class="i0">Dangerous secrets: for it tempts our powers.</div>
<div class="i0">Knowing what must be thought and may be done,</div>
<div class="i0">Into the depth of darkest purposes.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Still less is it the antithesis between intellectual and commonplace;
the highest intellectual powers find employment in
practical life. The various mental and moral qualities belong
to both spheres, but have a different meaning for each.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>Practical experience is a totally different thing from what the
religious thinker means by his 'experience.' The discipline
given by the world often consists in the dulling of those
powers which self-discipline seeks to develope. Knowledge
of affairs, with its rapid and instinctive grasp, is often
possessed in the highest degree by the man who is least of
all men versed in the other knowledge, which could explain
and analyse the processes by which it operated. And every
observer is struck by the different forms which courage takes
in the two spheres, courage in action, and courage where
nothing can be done and men have only to endure and wait.
Macaulay in a well-known passage contrasts the active and
passive courage as one of the distinctions between the West
and the East.</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>An European warrior, who rushes on a battery of cannon with a loud
hurrah, will sometimes shriek under the surgeon's knife, and fall into

murdered or dishonoured, without having the spirit to strike one blow,
has yet been known to endure torture with the firmness of Mucius, and

<div class="sidenote"><em>The antithesis

<p>It is obvious that relation to these two lives will have a
very great effect in determining individual character. In the
same man the two sides of experience may be most unequally
developed; an intellectual giant is often a child in
the affairs of the world, and a moral hero may be found in
the person of some bedridden cripple. On the other hand,
to some the inner life is hardly known: familiar perhaps with
every other branch of knowledge they go down to their
graves strangers to themselves.</p>

<p>The antithesis then between the outer and inner life will be
among the ideas which lie at the root of Character-Interpretation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>In a simple

<p>When the idea is applied to an age like that of Macbeth, the
antithesis between the two lives almost coincides with the distinction
of the sexes: amid the simple conditions of life belonging
to such an age the natural tendency would be for genius
in men to find scope in the outer and practical world, while
genius in women would be restricted to the inner life. And
this is the idea I am endeavouring to work out in the present
study:&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><em>The antithesis
the
key to the
characters
of Macbeth
and Lady
Macbeth.</em></span>that the key to Shakespeare's portraiture of Macbeth
and Lady Macbeth will be found in regarding the two as
illustrations of the outer and inner life. Both possess force
in the highest degree, but the two have been moulded by
the exercise of this force in different spheres; their characters
are in the play brought into sharp contrast by their
common enterprise, and the contrast of practical and intellectual
mind is seen maintained through the successive
stages of their descent to ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Macbeth as
the practical
man.</em></div>

<p>Thus Macbeth is essentially the practical man, the man
of action, of the highest experience, power, and energy in
military and political command, accustomed to the closest connection
between willing and doing. He is one who in another
age would have worked out the problem of free trade, or
unified Germany, or engineered the Suez Canal. On the
other hand, he has concerned himself little with things transcendental;
he is poorly disciplined in thought and goodness;
prepared for any emergency in which there is anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>to be <em>done</em>, yet a mental crisis or a moral problem afflicts
him with the shock of an unfamiliar situation. This is by
no means a generally accepted view: amongst a large
number of readers the traditional conception of Macbeth
lingers as a noble disposition dragged down by his connection
with the coarser nature of his wife. <span class="sidenote"><em>His nobility
conventional.</em></span>According to
the view here suggested the nobility of Macbeth is of the
flimsiest and most tawdry kind. The lofty tone he is found
at times assuming means no more than virtuous education
and surroundings. When the purely practical nature is
examined in reference to the qualities which belong to the
intellectual life, the result is not a blank but ordinariness:
the practical nature will reflect current thought and goodness
as they appear from the outside. So Macbeth's is the
morality of inherited notions, retained just because he has
no disposition to examine them; he has all the practical
man's distrust of wandering from the beaten track of opinion,
which gives the working politician his prejudice against doctrinaires,
and has raised up stout defenders of the Church
amongst men whose lives were little influenced by her teaching.
And the traditionary morality is more than merely retained.
When the seed fell into stony ground forthwith it sprang
up <em>because</em> it had no deepness of earth: the very shallowness
of a man's character may lend emphasis to his high professions,
just as, on the other hand, earnestness in its first
stage often takes the form of hesitation. So Macbeth's
practical genius takes in strongly what it takes in at all, and
gives it out vigorously. But that the nobility has gone beyond
the stage of passive recognition, that it has become absorbed
into his inner nature, there is not a trace; on the contrary,
it is impossible to follow Macbeth's history far without
abundant evidence that real love of goodness for its own
sake, founded on intelligent choice or deep affection, has
failed to root a single fibre in his nature.</p>

<p>First, we have the opportunity of studying Macbeth's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>character in the analysis given of it in the play itself by the
one person who not only saw Macbeth in his public life, but
knew also the side of him hidden from the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Lady Macbeth's
analysis of
her husband's
character.</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> v. 16-31.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Lady Macbeth.</em>
<span class="i6b">I fear thy nature;</span></div>
<div class="i2">It is too full o' the milk of human kindness</div>
<div class="i2">To catch the nearest way.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I believe that this phrase, the 'milk of human kindness,'
divorced from its context and become the most familiar of
all commonplaces, has done more than anything else towards
giving a false twist to the general conception of
Macbeth's character. The words <em>kind, kindness</em> are amongst
the most difficult words in Shakespeare. The wide original
signification of the root, <em>natural, nature</em>, still retained in the
noun <em>kind</em>, has been lost in the adjective, which has been
narrowed by modern usage to one sort of naturalness, tender-heartedness;
though in a derivative form the original
sense is still familiar to modern ears in the expression 'the
<em>kindly</em> fruits of the earth.' In Elizabethan English, however,
the root signification still remained in all usages of <em>kind</em> and
its derivatives. In Schmidt's analysis of the adjective, two
of its four significations agree with the modern use, the
other two are 'keeping to nature, natural,' and 'not degenerate
and corrupt, but such as a thing or person ought to
be.' Shakespeare delights to play upon the two senses of
this family of words: <span class="sidenote"><em>Much Ado,</em>
<strong>i.</strong> i. 26.</span>tears of joy are described as a 'kind
overflow of kindness'; the Fool says of Regan that she will
use Lear 'kindly,' i.e. according to her nature;
<span class="sidenote"><em>Lr.</em> <strong>i.</strong> v. 15.</span>'the worm
will do his kind,' i.e. bite. <span class="sidenote"><em>Ant. and
Cleop.</em> <strong>v.</strong> ii.
264.</span>How far the word can wander
from its modern sense is seen in a phrase of the present
play, <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 24.</span>'at your kind'st leisure,' where it is simply equivalent
to 'convenient.' Still more will the wider signification of
the word obtain, when it is associated with the word <em>human</em>;
'humankind' is still an expression for human nature, and
the sense of the passage we are considering would be more
obvious if the whole phrase were printed as one word, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>'human kindness,' but 'humankind-ness':&mdash;that shrinking
from what is not natural, which is a marked feature of the
practical nature. The other part of the clause, <em>milk</em> of
humankind-ness, no doubt suggests absence of hardness:
but it equally connotes natural, inherited, traditional feelings,
imbibed at the mother's breast. The whole expression of
Lady Macbeth, then, I take to attribute to her husband an
instinctive tendency to shrink from whatever is in any way
unnatural. That this is the true sense further appears, not
only from the facts&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 54.</span>for nothing in the play suggests that
Macbeth, 'Bellona's bridegroom,' was distinguished by kindness
in the modern sense&mdash;but from the context. The
form of Lady Macbeth's speech makes the phrase under
discussion a summing up of the rest of her analysis, or
rather a general text which she proceeds to expand into
details. Not one of these details has any connection with
tender-heartedness: on the other hand, if put together the
details do amount to the sense for which I am contending,
that Macbeth's character is a type of commonplace morality,
the shallow unthinking and unfeeling man's lifelong hesitation
between God and Mammon.</p>
<div class="center">

<p>If the delicate balancing of previous clauses had left any
doubt as to the meaning, the last two lines remove it, and
assert distinctly that Macbeth has no objection to the evil
itself, but only a fear of evil measures which must be associated
to a practical mind with failure and disgrace.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 48-53.</span>It is
striking that at the very moment Lady Macbeth is so meditating,
her husband is giving a practical confirmation of her

<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 143,

surrenders himself seem like an echo of his wife's analysis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Macbeth's
soliloquy:
of an eminently
practical
character.</em></div>

<p>But we are not left to descriptions of Macbeth by others.
We have him self-displayed; and that in a situation so
framed that if there were in him the faintest sympathy with
goodness it must here be brought into prominence.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> vii. 1-28.</span>Macbeth
has torn himself away from the banquet, and, his mind
full of the desperate danger of the treason he is meditating,
he ponders over the various motives that forbid its execution.
A strong nobility would even amid incentives <em>to</em> crime feel
the attraction of virtue and have to struggle against it; but
surely the weakest nobility, when facing motives <em>against</em> sin,
would be roused to some degree of virtuous passion. Yet,
if Macbeth's famous soliloquy be searched through and
through, not a single thought will be found to suggest that
he is regarding the deep considerations of sin and retribution
in any other light than that of immediate practical
consequences. First, there is the thought of the sureness of
retribution even in this world. It may be true that hope of
heaven and fear of hell are not the highest of moral incentives,
but at least they are a degree higher than the thought
of worldly prosperity and failure; Macbeth however is willing
to take his chance of the next world if only he can be
guaranteed against penalties in this life.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well</div>
<div class="i0">It were done quickly: if the assassination</div>

<div class="i0">With his surcease success; that but this blow</div>
<div class="i0">Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</div>

<div class="i0">We still have judgement here; that we but teach</div>

<div class="i0">Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice</div>
<div class="i0">To our own lips.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So far he has reached no higher consideration, in reference
to treason and murder, than the fear that he may be suggesting
to others to use against himself the weapon he is
intending for Duncan. Then his thoughts turn to the
motives against crime which belong to the softer side of our
nature.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i7">He's here in double trust,</div>
<div class="i0">First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</div>
<div class="i0">Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,</div>
<div class="i0">Who should against his murderer shut the door,</div>
<div class="i0">Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan,</div>
<div class="i0">Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</div>
<div class="i0">So clear in his great office, that his virtues</div>
<div class="i0">Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against</div>
<div class="i0">The deep damnation of his taking-off;</div>
<div class="i0">And pity&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At all events it is clear this is no case of a man blinded for
the moment to the emotions which resist crime; and as we
hear him passing in review kinship, loyalty, hospitality, pity,
we listen for the burst of remorse with which he will hurl
from him the treachery he had been fostering. But, on the
contrary, his thoughts are still practical, and the climax to
which this survey of motives is to lead up is no more than
the effect they will have on others: pity</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</div>
<div class="i0">That tears shall drown the wind.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And then he seems to regret that he cannot find more incentives
to his villainy.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
<div class="i9">I have no spur</div>
<div class="i0">To prick the sides of my intent, but only</div>
<div class="i0">Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself</div>
<div class="i0">And falls on the other.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So Macbeth's searching self-examination on topics of sin and
retribution, amid circumstances specially calculated to rouse
compunction, results in thoughts not more noble than these&mdash;that
murder is a game which two parties can play at, that
heartlessness has the effect of drawing general attention, that
ambition is apt to defeat its own object.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Macbeth
rises with
external
deeds and
sinks with
internal
conflicts.</em></div>

<p>Again: that Macbeth's union of superficial nobility with
real moral worthlessness is connected with the purely practical
bent of his mind will be the more evident the wider
the survey which is taken of his character and actions. It
may be observed that Macbeth's spirits always rise with evil
deeds: however he may have wavered in the contemplation
of crime, its execution strings him up to the loftiest tone.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, from
31; and
<strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
39.</span>This is especially clear in the Dagger Scene, and in the
scene in which he darkly hints to his wife the murder of
Banquo, which is in a brief space to be in actual perpetration.
As he feels the moment of crime draw near, his whole
figure seems to dilate, the language rises, and the imagery
begins to flow. Like a poet invoking his muse, Macbeth
calls on seeling night to scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day.
He has an eye to dramatic surroundings for his dark deeds.</p>
<div class="center">

<p>The man who had an hour or two before been driven from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>the table of his guests by the mere thought of a crime moves
to the deed itself with the exalted language of a Hebrew prophet.
On the other hand, in his spiritual struggles there is
a simpleness that sometimes suggests childishness.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 31.</span>
His trouble is that he could not say 'Amen' when the sleepers
cried 'God bless us'; his conscience seems a voice outside
him; <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 35-46.</span>finally, the hardened warrior dare not return to the
darkness and face the victim he had so exultingly done to
death.</p>

<p>Macbeth, then, is the embodiment of one side of the antithesis
with which we started; his is pre-eminently the practical
nature, moulded in a world of action, but uninfluenced
by the cultivation of the inner life. Yet he is not perfect
as a man of action: for the practical cannot reach its perfection
without the assistance of the inner life. <span class="sidenote"><em>Two flaws
in Macbeth
as an embodiment
of
the practical:
his superstition;</em></span>There are
two flaws in Macbeth's completeness. For one, his lack of
training in thought has left him without protection against
the superstition of his age. He is a passive prey to supernatural
imaginings.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> v. 10.</span>He himself tells us he is a man whose
senses would cool to hear a night-shriek, and his fell of hair
rouse at a dismal treatise. And we see throughout the play
how he never for an instant doubts the reality of the supernatural
appearances: <span class="sidenote">e.g. <strong>iii.</strong> iv.
60; <strong>i.</strong> iii.
107, 122.</span>
a feature the more striking from its
contrast with the scepticism of Lady Macbeth, and the
hesitating doubt of Banquo. <span class="sidenote"><em>and his
helplessness
under suspense.</em></span>
Again: no active career can
be without its periods when action is impossible, <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 6.</span>and it is in
such periods that the training given by the intellectual life
makes itself felt, with its self-control and passive courage.
All this Macbeth lacks: in suspense he has no power of
self-restraint. <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> iii. 137,
and <strong>iii.</strong> ii.
16.</span>When we come to trace him through the
stages of the action we shall find that one of these two flaws
springing out of Macbeth's lack of the inner life, his superstition
and his helplessness in suspense, is at every turn the
source of his betrayal.</p>

<p>In the case of Lady Macbeth, the old-fashioned view of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>her as a second Clytæmnestra has long been steadily giving
way before a conception higher at least on the intellectual
side. <span class="sidenote"><em>Lady Macbeth
as an
embodiment
of the
inner life.</em></span>The exact key to her character is given by regarding
her as the antithesis of her husband, and an embodiment of
the inner life and its intellectual culture so markedly wanting
in him. She has had the feminine lot of being shut out
from active life, and her genius and energy have been turned
inwards;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i. 58.</span>her soul&mdash;like her 'little hand'&mdash;is not hardened
for the working-day world, but is quick, delicate, sensitive.
She has the keenest insight into the characters of those
around her. She is accustomed to moral loneliness and
at home in mental struggles. She has even solved for
herself some of their problems. In the very crisis of Duncan's
murder she gives utterance to the sentiment:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 53.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i5">the sleeping and the dead</div>
<div class="i0">Are but as pictures.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When we remember that she must have started with the
superstitions of her age such an expression, simple enough
in modern lips, opens up to us a whole drama of personal
history: we can picture the trembling curiosity, the struggle
between will and quivering nerves, the triumph chequered
with awe, the resurrection of doubts, the swayings between
natural repulsion and intellectual thirst, the growing courage
and the reiterated victories settling down into calm principle.
Accordingly, Lady Macbeth has won the grand
prize of the inner life: in the kingdom of her personal
experience her <span class="smcap">WILL</span> is unquestioned king. It may seem
strange to some readers that Lady Macbeth should be held
up as the type of the inner life, so associated is that phrase
to modern ears with the life fostered by religion. But the
two things must not be confused&mdash;religion and the sphere in
which religion is exercised. 'The kingdom of God is within
you,' was the proclamation of Christ, but the world within
<em>may</em> be subjugated to other kings than God. Mental discipline
and perfect self-control, like that of Lady Macbeth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>would hold their sway over evil passions, but they would
also be true to her when she chose to contend against
goodness, and even against the deepest instincts of her
feminine nature. <span class="sidenote"><em>A struggle
against not
absence of
the softer
qualities.</em></span>This was ignored in the old conception of
the character, and a struggle <em>against</em> the softer side of her
nature was mistaken for its total absence. But her intellectual
culture must have quickened her finer sensibilities
at the same time that it built up a will strong enough to
hold them down; nor is the subjugation so perfect but
that a sympathetic insight can throughout trace a keen
delicacy of nature striving to assert itself.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> v. 41.</span>In particular,
when she calls upon the spirits that tend on mortal thoughts
to unsex and fill her from crown to toe with direst cruelty,
she is thrilling all over with feminine repugnance to the
bloody enterprise, which nevertheless her royal will insists
upon her undertaking. Lady Macbeth's career in the play
is one long mental civil war: and the strain ends, as such a
strain could only end, in madness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Character-Contrast
traced
through the
action.</em></div>

<p>Such is the general conception of Lord and Lady Macbeth
from the point of view of the antithesis between the
outer and inner life. We have now to turn from character
to action, and trace the contrasted pair through the stages of
their common career.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Situation
at the opening
of the
play.</em></div>

<p>The two opposing natures have been united in a happy
marriage, the happier because a link between characters so
forceful and so antithetic, if it held at all, must be a source of
interest: <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> v. 55-60;
<strong>i.</strong> vii. 38;
<strong>iii.</strong> ii. 27,
29, 36, 45;
<strong>iii.</strong> iv. 141.</span>the dark tragedy of this unhappy pair is softened by
the tenderness of demeanour which appears on both sides.
Another source of marriage happiness is added: there is not
a trace of self-seeking in Lady Macbeth. Throughout the
play she is never found meditating upon what she is to gain
by the crown; wife-like, she has no sphere but the career of
her husband. <span class="sidenote"><em>The original
impulse
to evil came
from Macbeth.</em></span>In a picture of human characters, great in
their scale, overwhelmed in moral ruin, the question of
absorbing interest is the commencement of the descent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>the source from which the impulse to evil has come. This,
in the present case, Shakespeare has carefully hidden from
us: before the play opens the essential surrender of spirit
has taken place, and all that we are allowed to see is its
realisation in life and fact. If, however, we use the slight
material afforded us for speculation on this point, it would
appear that the original choice for evil has for both been
made by Macbeth. In the partnership of man and wife it is
generally safe to assume that the initiative of action has
come from the husband, if nothing appears to the contrary.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> vii. 48.</span>In the present case we are not left to assumptions, Lady
Macbeth distinctly speaks of her husband as first breaking
to her the enterprise of treacherous ambition.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i5">What beast was't, then,</div>
<div class="i0">Which made you break this enterprise to me?</div>
<div class="i8">... Nor time nor place</div>
<div class="i0">Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The reference can only be to a period before the commencement
of the play; and the general drift of the passage suggests
that it was no mere choice, made by Macbeth with
deliberation during which he would be open to conviction,
but an impulse of uncontrollable passion that it would have
been vain for his wife to resist, supposing that she had had
the desire to resist it&mdash;so uncontrollable, indeed,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> vii. 54.</span>that it
appears to Lady Macbeth stronger than the strongest of
feminine passions, a mother's love.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i5">I have given suck, and know</div>
<div class="i0">How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:</div>
<div class="i0">I would, while it was smiling in my face,</div>
<div class="i0">Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,</div>
<div class="i0">And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you</div>
<div class="i0">Have done to this.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The only sense in which Lady Macbeth can be pronounced
the ruin of her husband is that her firm nature holds him in
the path to which he has committed them both, and will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>allow his fatal faltering to lose both the virtue he has renounced
and the price for which he has bartered it. Denied
by her feminine position, the possibility&mdash;even if she had
had the desire&mdash;of directing the common lot for good, she
has recognised before we make her acquaintance that this
lot has been cast for evil, and she is too well-trained in self-knowledge
to attempt the self-deception her husband tries to
keep up.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> vii. 54.</span>And to this evil lot she applies her full force. Her
children have died, and this natural outlet for passion is
wanting; the whole of her energy is brought to bear upon
her husband's ambition, and she is waiting only an occasion
for concentrating her powers upon some definite
project.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Four
stages in
the action.</em></div>

<p>With such mutual relations between the hero and the
heroine the play opens: we are to watch the contrasted
characters through the successive stages of the Temptation,
the Deed, the Concealment, the Nemesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Temptation.</em></div>

<p>The Temptation accosts the two personages when separated
from one another, and we thus have the better
opportunity of watching the different forms it assumes in
adapting itself to the different characters. The expedition,
which has separated Macbeth from his wife, is one which
must have led him to brood over his schemes of ambition.
Certainly it exhibits to him an example of treason and shows
him the weakness of his sovereign. Probably he sees events
shaping in a direction that suggests opportunity; he may
have known that the king must pass in the direction of his
castle, or in some other way may have anticipated a royal
visit; at all events the king's intimation of this visit in the
play itself&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>'Thou shalt be <span class="smcap">King</span> hereafter,' Macbeth gives a start that
astonishes Banquo:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear</div>
<div class="i0">Things that do sound so fair?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To Banquo this prediction of the Witches seems no more
than curious; for it must be remembered that Macbeth's
position in the kingdom was not such as to exclude hope of
succession to the crown, though the hope was a remote one.
But Macbeth's start tells a tale of his inner thoughts at the
time. This alone should be sufficient to vindicate Shakespeare
from the charge sometimes brought against him of
turning a great character from virtue to vice by demoniac
agency; his is the higher conception that a soul which has
commenced the surrender to evil will find in the powers of
darkness agencies ready to expedite its descent, it matters
not what form these agencies assume. Macbeth has been
for years playing with the idea of treason, while never
bracing himself up to the point of acting it: suddenly the
thought he fancied so safe within his bosom appears outside
him in tangible form, gleaming at him in the malignant
glances of recognition the Witches are casting at him. To a
mind utterly undefended by culture against superstitious
terror this objective presentation of his own thought proves
a Rubicon of temptation which he never attempts to recross.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> v. 1-55.</span>
On Lady Macbeth the supernatural incident makes not the
slightest impression of any kind; we see her reading her
husband's excited account of the interview with the most
deliberate calmness, weighing its suggestions only with reference
to the question how it can be used upon her husband.
To her temptation comes with the suggestion of <em>opportunity</em>.
The messenger enters during her quiet meditation;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Mess.</em> The king comes here to-night.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Lady M.</em>  <span class="i6b">Thou 'rt mad to say it!</span></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The shock that passes over her is like the shock of chemical
change. In an instant her whole nature is strung up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>a single end; the long-expected occasion for the concentration
of a whole life's energy upon a decisive stroke is
come. So rapidly does her imagination move that she sees
the deed before her as already done, and, as she casts her
eyes upwards, the very ravens over her head seem to be
croaking the fatal entrance of Duncan under her battlements.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The meeting
afterwards.</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> v, from
55: <strong>i.</strong> vii.</div>

<p>The stage of Temptation cannot be considered complete
without taking in that important section of the play which
intervenes between the meeting of the two personages after
their separate temptations and the accomplishment of the
treason. This is essentially a period of suspense, and accordingly
exhibits Macbeth at his weakest. As he enters
his castle his tell-tale face is as a book where men may
read strange matters; and his utter powerlessness of self-control
throws upon his wife's firm will the strongest of all
strains, that of infusing her own tenacity into a vacillating
ally. I have already dealt with the point at which Macbeth's
suspense becomes intolerable, and he leaves the supper-table;
and I have drawn attention to the eminently practical nature
of his thoughts even at this crisis. The scene which follows,
when his wife labours to hold him to the enterprise he has
undertaken, illustrates perhaps better than any other incident
in the play how truly this practical bent is the key to Macbeth's
whole character. At first he takes high ground, and
rests his hesitation on considerations of gratitude. Lady
Macbeth appeals to consistency, to their mutual love, and,
her anger beginning to rise at this wavering of will in a
critical moment, she taunts her husband with cowardice.
Then it is that Macbeth, irritated in his turn, speaks the
noble words that have done so much to gain him a place in
the army of martyrs to wifely temptations.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i7">Prithee, peace:</div>
<div class="i0">I dare do all that may become a man;</div>
<div class="i0">Who dares do more is none.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>

But it is difficult to share Macbeth's self-deception long. At
his wife's reminder how he had been the one to first moot the
undertaking, and swear to it in spite of overwhelming obstacles,
already the noble attitude looks more like the sour
grapes morality of the man who begins to feel indignation
against sin at the precise moment when the sin becomes
dangerous. And the whole truth comes sneaking out at
Macbeth's next rejoinder: 'If we should fail?' Here is
the critical point of the scene. <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> vii, from
61.</span>At its beginning Macbeth
is for abandoning the treason, at its end he prepares for
his task of murder with animation: where does the change
come? <em>The practical man is nerved by having the practical
details supplied to him.</em> Lady Macbeth sketches a feasible
scheme: how that the King will be wearied, his chamberlains
can by means of the banquet be easily drugged, their confusion
on waking can be interpreted as guilt&mdash;before she has
half done her husband interrupts her with a burst of enthusiasm,
and completes her scheme for her. The man who
had thought it was manliness that made him shrink from
murder henceforward never hesitates till he has plunged his
dagger in his sovereign's bosom.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Deed</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 31 to
<strong>ii.</strong> ii.</div>

<p>In the perpetration of the Deed itself we have the woman
passing from weakness to strength, the man from strength to
weakness. To Lady Macbeth this actual contact with a deed
of blood is the severest point of the strain, the part most
abhorrent to her more delicate nature. For a single moment
she feels herself on the verge of the madness which eventually
comes upon her:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 33.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">These deeds must not be thought</div>
<div class="i0">After these ways; so, it will make us mad!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And at the beginning of the scene she has been obliged to
have recourse to stimulants in order to brace her failing
nerves:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 1.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>

And in part the attempt to bring her delicate nature to the
repugnant deed does fail. It is clear that, knowing how
little her husband could be depended upon, she had intended
to have a hand in the murder itself:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> vii. 69;
compare
<strong>i.</strong> v. 68.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What cannot <em>you and I</em> perform upon</div>
<div class="i0">The unguarded Duncan?</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>But the will which was strong enough to hold down conscience
gave way for a moment before an instinct of feminine
tenderness:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 13.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">Had he not resembled</div>
<div class="i0">My father as he slept, I had done 't.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The superiority, however, of the intellectual mind is seen in
this, that it can nerve itself from its own agitation, it can
draw strength out of the weakness surrounding it, or out of
the necessities of the situation: <em>must</em> is the most powerful of
spells to a trained will. And so it is that Lady Macbeth rises
to the occasion when her husband fails. At first Macbeth in
the perpetration of the murder appears in his proper sphere
of action, and we have already noticed how the Dagger
Soliloquy shows no shrinking, but rather excitement on the
side of exultation. The change in him comes with a moment
of suspense, caused by the momentary waking of the grooms:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 24.</span>'I stood and heard them.' With this, no longer sustained
by action, he utterly breaks down under the unfamiliar terrors
of a fight with his conscience. His prayer sticks in his throat;
his thoughts seem so vivid that his wife can hardly tell whether
he did not take them for a real voice outside him.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,</div>
<div class="i0">You do unbend your noble strength, to think</div>
<div class="i0">So brainsickly of things.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In his agitation he forgets the plan of action, brings away
the daggers instead of leaving them with the grooms, and
finally dares not return to finish what he has left uncompleted.
And accordingly his wife has to make another demand upon
her overwrought nature: with one hysterical jest,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
<div class="i8">If he do bleed,</div>
<div class="i0">I'll <em>gild</em> the faces of the grooms withal,</div>
<div class="i0">For it must seem their <em>guilt</em>,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>her nature rallies, and the strength derived from the inner
life fills up a gap in action where the mere strength of action
had failed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The first
Shock of
Concealment.</em></div>
<div class="sidenote">
<strong>ii.</strong>
iii, from 68.</div>

<p>The Concealment of the murder forms a stage of the
action which falls into two different parts: the single effort
which faces the first shock of discovery, and the very different
strain required to meet the slowly gathering evidence of guilt.
In the Scene of the Discovery Macbeth is perfectly at home:
energetic action is needed, and he is dealing with men. His
acted innocence appears to me better than his wife's; Lady
Macbeth goes near to suggesting a personal interest in the
crime by her over-anxiety to disclaim it.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Macduff.</em>
<span class="i6b">O Banquo, Banquo,</span></div>
<div class="i2">Our royal master's murder'd!</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Lady M.</em>
<span class="i6b">Woe, alas!</span></div>
<div class="i2">What, in our house?</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Banquo.</em>
<span class="i6b">Too cruel anywhere.</span></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Yet in this scene, as everywhere else, the weak points in
Macbeth's character betray him: for one moment he is left
to himself, and that moment's suspense ruins the whole
episode. In the most natural manner in the world Macbeth
had, on hearing the announcement, rushed with Lennox to the
scene of the murder. Lennox quitted the chamber of blood
first, and for an instant Macbeth was alone, facing the grooms
still heavy with their drugged sleep, and knowing that in
another moment they would be aroused and telling their
tale: the sense of crisis proves too much for him, and under
an ungovernable impulse he stabs them. He thus wrecks
the whole scheme. How perfectly Lady Macbeth's plan
would have served if it had been left to itself is seen by
Lennox's account of what he had seen, and how the grooms</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">stared, and were distracted; no man's life</div>
<div class="i0">Was to be trusted with them.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>

Nothing, it is true, can be finer than the way in which Macbeth
seeks to cover his mistake and announces what he has
done. But in spite of his brilliant outburst,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,</div>
<div class="i0">Loyal and neutral, in a moment?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and his vivid word-picture of his supposed sensations, his
efforts are in vain, and at the end of his speech we feel that
there has arisen in the company of nobles the indescribable
effect known as 'a sensation,' and we listen for some one to
speak some word that shall be irrevocable.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 124.</span>The crisis is
acute, but Lady Macbeth comes to the rescue <em>and faints</em>!
It matters little whether we suppose the fainting assumed,
or that she yields to the agitation she has been fighting
against so long. The important point is that she chooses
this exact moment for giving way: she holds out to the end
of her husband's speech, then falls with a cry for help; there
is at once a diversion, and she is carried out.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 132.</span>But the crisis
has passed, and a moment's consideration has suggested to
the nobles the wisdom of adjourning for a fitter occasion the
enquiry into the murder they all suspect:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 24-32.</span>before that occasion
arrives the flight of the king's sons has diverted suspicion into
an entirely new channel. Lady Macbeth's fainting saved her
husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The long
Strain of
Concealment.</em></div>
<div class="sidenote">
<strong>iii.</strong>
i, ii.</div>

<p>To convey dramatically the continuous strain of keeping
up appearances in face of steadily accumulating suspicion is
more difficult than to depict a single crisis. Shakespeare
manages it in the present case chiefly by presenting Macbeth
to us on the eve of an important council, at which the whole
truth is likely to come out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong> iii.</strong> i. 30.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers</div>
<div class="i0">With strange invention: but of that to-morrow.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is enough to note here that Macbeth takes the step&mdash;the
fatal step, as was pointed out in the last study&mdash;of contriving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>Banquo's murder simply because he cannot face the suspense
of waiting for the morrow, and hearing the defence of the
innocent princes made in presence of Banquo, who knows
the inducement he had to such a deed. That he feels the
danger of the crime, which nevertheless he cannot hold himself
back from committing, is clear from the fact that he will
not submit it to the calmer judgment of his wife.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 45.</span>The contrast
of the two characters appears here as everywhere. Lady
Macbeth can <em>wait</em> for an opportunity of freeing themselves
from Banquo:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 37.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0"><em>Lady M.</em> But in them nature's copy's not eterne.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>To Macbeth the one thing impossible is to wait; and once
more his powerlessness to control suspense is his ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The first
Shock of
Nemesis.</em></div>

<p>We have reviewed the contrasted characters under Temptation,
in the Deed of sin itself, and in the struggle for Concealment:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv.</span>it remains to watch them face to face with their
Nemesis. In the present play Shakespeare has combined the
nemesis which takes the form of a sudden shock with the yet
severer nemesis of a hopeless resistance through the stages of
a protracted fall. The first Shock of Nemesis comes in the
Banquet Scene. Macbeth has surrendered himself to the
supernatural, and from the supernatural his retribution comes.
This is not the place to draw out the terrible force of this
famous scene; for its bearing on the contrast of character
under delineation it is to be remarked that Macbeth faces his
ghostly visitation with unflinching courage, yet without a
shadow of doubt as to the reality of what nevertheless no one
sees but himself. Lady Macbeth is equally true to her
character, and fights on to the last in the now hopeless
contest&mdash;her double task of keeping up appearances for herself
and for her husband. Her keen tact in dealing with
Macbeth is to be noted. At first she rallies him angrily, and
seeks to shame him into self-command; a moment shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>that he is too far gone to be reached by such motives. Instantly
she changes her tactics, and, employing a device so
often effective with patients of disordered brain, she endeavours
to recall him to his senses by assuming an ordinary
tone of voice; hitherto she has whispered, now, in the hearing
of all, she makes the practical remark:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 83.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">My worthy lord,</div>
<div class="i0">Your noble friends do lack you.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The device proves successful, his nerves respond to the tone
of everyday life, and recovering himself he uses all his skill
of deportment to efface the strangeness of the episode, until
the reappearance of his victim plunges the scene in confusion
past recovery. In the moment of crisis Lady Macbeth had
used roughness to rouse her husband;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv, from
122.</span>when the courtiers
are gone she is all tenderness. She utters not a word of reproach:
perhaps she is herself exhausted by the strain she has
gone through; more probably the womanly solicitude for the
physical sufferer thinks only how to procure for her husband
'the season of all natures, sleep.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The full
Nemesis.</em></div>

<p>At last the end comes. The final stage, like the first, is
brought to the two personages separately. Lady Macbeth
has faced every crisis by sheer force of nerve;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i.</span>the nemesis
comes upon her fitly in madness, the brain giving way under
the strain of contest which her will has forced upon it. In
the delirium of her last appearance before us we can trace
three distinct tones of thought working into one another as if
in some weird harmony. There is first the mere reproduction
of the horrible scenes she has passed through.</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>One: two: why then 'tis time to do 't.... Yet who would have
thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.... The thane
of Fife had a wife: where is she now?</p></div>

<p>Again there is an inner thought contending with the first, the
struggle to keep her husband from betraying himself by his
irresolution.</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>starting.... Wash your hands, put on your night-gown; look not so
pale.... Fie! a soldier and afear'd?</p></div>

<p>And there is an inmost thought of all: the uprising of her
feminine nature against the foulness of the violent deed.</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>Out, damned spot!... Here's the smell of blood still: all the perfumes
of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand&mdash;</p></div>

<p>and the 'sorely charged heart' vents itself in a sigh which
the attendants shudder to hear. On Macbeth Nemesis heaps
itself in double form. The purely practical man, without
resources in himself, finds nemesis in an old age that receives
no honour from others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> iii. 22.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">I must not look to have, but, in their stead,</div>
<div class="i0">Curses, not loud, but deep.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, as the drunkard finds his refuge in drink, so the
victim of superstition longs for deeper draughts of the supernatural.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i.</span>Macbeth seeks the Witches, forces himself to hear
the worst, <span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 110-135.</span>and suffers nemesis in anticipation in viewing
future generations which are to see his foes on his throne.
<span class="sidenote">from <strong>iv.</strong> i.

when Macbeth is seen resting in unquestioning reliance on an
ironical oracle: <span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> v, from

<p class="right"><em>A Study in Character-Grouping.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Character-Grouping.</em></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> lover of art feels that the different fine arts form not
a crowd but a family; the more familiar the mind becomes
with them the more it delights to trace in them the application
of common ideas to different media of expression. We
are reminded of this essential unity by the way in which the
arts borrow their terms from one another. 'Colour' is applied
to music, 'tone' to painting; we speak of costume as 'loud,'
of melody as 'bright,' of orchestration as 'massive.' Two
classes of oratorical style have been distinguished as
'statuesque' and 'picturesque'; while the application of a
musical term, 'harmony,' and a term of sculpture, 'relief,' to
all the arts alike is so common that the transference is
scarcely felt. Such usages are not the devices of a straitened
vocabulary, but are significant of a single <em>Art</em> which is felt
to underlie the special <em>arts</em>. So the more Drama is brought
by criticism into the family of the fine arts the more it will be
seen to present the common features. We have already had
to notice repeatedly how the idea of pattern or design is the
key to dramatic plot. We are in the present study to see how
contrast of character, such as was traced in the last study
between Lord and Lady Macbeth, when applied to a larger
number of personages, produces an effect on the mind
analogous to that of <em>grouping</em> in pictures and statuary: the
different personages not only present points of contrast with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
one another, but their varieties suddenly fall into a unity of
effect if looked at from some one point of view.
<span class="sidenote"><em>
The grouping in Julius Cæsar rests on the antithesis of the practical
and inner life.</em></span>An example of such Character-Grouping is seen in the play
of <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, where the four leading figures, all on the grandest
scale, have the elements of their characters thrown into relief by
comparison with one another, and the contrast stands out boldly when the
four are reviewed in relation to one single idea.</p>

<p>This idea is the same as that which lay at the root of the
Character-Contrast in <em>Macbeth</em>&mdash;the antithesis of the practical
and inner life. It is, however, applied in a totally different
sphere. Instead of a simple age in which the lives coincide
with the sexes we are carried to the other extreme of civilisation,
the final age of Roman liberty, and all four personages
are merged in the busy world of political life. Naturally, then,
the contrast of the two lives takes in this play a different
form. <span class="sidenote"><em>This takes
the form of
individual
sympathies</em>
v. <em>public
policy.</em></span>In the play of <em>Macbeth</em> the inner life was seen in the
force of will which could hold down alike bad and good
impulses; while the outer life was made interesting by its
confinement to the training given by action, and an exhibition
of it devoid of the thoughtfulness and self-control for
which the life of activity has to draw upon the inner life.
But there is another aspect in which the two may be regarded.
The idea of the inner life is reflected in the word
'individuality,' or that which a man has not in common with
others. The cultivation of the inner life implies not merely
cultivation of our own individuality, but to it also belongs
sympathy with the individuality of others; whereas in the
sphere of practical life men fall into classes, and each person
has his place as a member of these classes. Thus
benevolence may take the form of enquiring into individual
wants and troubles and meeting these by personal
assistance; but a man has an equal claim to be called
benevolent who applies himself to such sciences as political
economy, studies the springs which regulate human society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>and by influencing these in the right direction confers
benefits upon whole classes at a time. Charity and political
science are the two forms benevolence assumes correspondent
to the inner life of individual sympathies and the outer
life of public action. Or, if we consider the contrast from
the side of rights as distinguished from duties, the supreme
form in which the rights of individuals may be summed
up is justice; the corresponding claim which public life
makes upon us is (in the highest sense of the term) policy:
wherever these two, justice and policy, seem to clash, the outer
and inner life are brought into conflict. It is in this form
that the conflict is raised in the play of <em>Julius Cæsar</em>. To
get it in its full force, the dramatist goes to the world of
antiquity, for one of the leading distinctions between ancient
and modern society is that the modern world gives the fullest
play to the individual, while in ancient systems the individual
was treated as existing solely for the state. 'Liberty' has
been a watchword in both ages; but while we mean by liberty
the least amount of interference with personal activity, the
liberty for which ancient patriots contended was freedom of
the government from external or internal control, and the
ideal republic of Plato was so contrived as to reduce individual
liberty to a minimum. And this subordination of
private to public was most fully carried out in Rome. 'The
common weal,' says Merivale, 'was after all the grand object
of the heroes of Roman story. Few of the renowned heroes
of old had attained their eminence as public benefactors
without steeling their hearts against the purest instincts of
nature. The deeds of a Brutus or a Manlius, of a Sulla
or a Cæsar, would have been branded as crimes in private
citizens; it was the public character of the actors that
stamped them with immortal glory in the eyes of their
countrymen.' Accordingly, the opposition of outer and
inner life is brought before us most keenly when, in Roman
life, a public policy, the cause of republican freedom, seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>to be bound up with the supreme crime against justice and
the rights of the individual, assassination.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Brutus's
character
so evenly
developed
that the
antithesis
disappears.</em></div>

<p>Brutus is the central figure of the group: in his character
the two sides are so balanced that the antithesis disappears.
This evenness of development in his nature is the thought of
those who in the play gather around his corpse; giving
prominence to the quality in Brutus hidden from the casual
observer they say:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> v. 73.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">His life was gentle; and the elements</div>
<div class="i0">So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</div>
<div class="i0">And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of another it would be said that he was a poet, a philosopher; of Brutus
the only true description was that he was a man! It is in very few
characters that force and softness are each carried to such perfection.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Force of his character.</em></span>
The strong side of Brutus's character is that
which has given to the whole play its characteristic tone. It is seen in
the way in which he appreciates the issue at stake. Weak men sin by
hiding from themselves what it is they do; Brutus is fully alive to the
foulness of conspiracy at the moment in which he is conspiring.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 77.</div>

<p>His high tone he carries into the darkest scenes of the play.
The use of criminal means has usually an intoxicating effect
upon the moral sense, and suggests to those once committed
to it that it is useless to haggle over the amount of the crime
until the end be obtained.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 162.</span>Brutus resists this intoxication,
setting his face against the proposal to include Antony in
Cæsar's fate, and resolving that not one life shall be unnecessarily
sacrificed. He scorns the refuge of suicide; and with

</div>
<p>The scale of Brutus's character is again brought out by his
relations with other personages of the play. Casca, with all
his cynical depreciation of others, has to bear unqualified
testimony to Brutus's greatness:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 157.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, fin.</div>

<p>We see Ligarius coming from a sick-bed to join in he knows
not what: 'it sufficeth that Brutus leads me on.' And the
hero's own thought, when at the point of death he pauses to
take a moment's survey of his whole life,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> v. 34.</span>is of the unfailing
power with which he has swayed the hearts of all around
him:</p>
<div class="center">

<div class="i0">My heart doth joy that yet in all my life</div>
<div class="i0">I found no man but he was true to me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Above all, contact with Cassius throws into relief the greatness
of Brutus.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii.</span>At the opening of the play it is Cassius that
we associate with the idea of force; but his is the ruling
mind only while Brutus is hesitating; as soon as Brutus has
thrown in his lot with the conspirators, Cassius himself is
swept along with the current of Brutus's irresistible influence.

is concerned, wrongly decided&mdash;against Cassius's better judgment.
In the sensational moment when Popilius Lena enters
the Senate-house and is seen to whisper Cæsar, Cassius's
presence of mind fails him,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 19.</span>and he prepares in despair for
suicide; Brutus retains calmness enough to <em>watch faces</em>:</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii.</div>

<p>In the Quarrel Scene Cassius has lost all pretensions to
dignity of action in the impatience sprung from a ruined
cause; Brutus maintains principle in despair. Finally, at the
close of the scene, when it is discovered that under all the
hardness of this contest for principle Brutus has been hiding
a heart broken by the loss of Portia,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii, from
145.</span>Cassius is forced to give
way and acknowledge Brutus's superiority to himself even in
his own ideal of impassiveness:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 194.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I have as much of this in art as you,</div>
<div class="i0">But yet my nature could not bear it so.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Its softness.</em></div>

<p>The force in Brutus's character is obvious: it is rather its
softer side that some readers find difficulty in seeing. But this
difficulty is in reality a testimony to Shakespeare's skill, for
Brutus is a Stoic, and what gentleness we see in him appears
in spite of himself. It may be seen in his culture of art,
music, and philosophy, which have such an effect in softening
the manners. Nor is this in the case of the Roman Brutus
a mere conventional culture: these tastes are among his
strongest passions.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 256.</span>When all is confusion around him on the
eve of the fatal battle he cannot restrain his longing for the
refreshing tones of his page's lyre; and, the music over, he
takes up his philosophical treatise at the page he had turned
down.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 242.</span>Again Brutus's considerateness for his dependants is
in strong contrast with the harshness of Roman masters.
On the same eve of the battle he insists that the men who
watch in his tent shall lie down instead of standing as discipline
would require.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii, from
252.</span>An exquisite little episode brings out
Brutus's sweetness of demeanour in dealing with his youthful
page; this rises to womanly tenderness at the end when,
noticing how the boy, wearied out and fallen asleep, is lying
in a position to injure his instrument, he rises and disengages
it without waking him.</p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, from
233.</div>

<p>Brutus's relations with Portia bear the same testimony.
Portia is a woman with as high a spirit as Lady Macbeth,
and she can inflict a wound on herself to prove her courage
and her right to share her husband's secrets. But she lacks
the physical nerve of Lady Macbeth;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv.</span>her agitation on the
morning of the assassination threatens to betray the conspirators,
and when these have to flee from Rome the
suspense is too much for her and she commits suicide.
Brutus knew his wife better than she knew herself, and was
right in seeking to withhold the fatal confidence; yet he
allowed himself to be persuaded: no man would be so
swayed by a tender woman unless he had a tender spirit of
his own. In all these ways we may trace an extreme of
gentleness in Brutus.
<span class="sidenote"><em>This is
concealed
under stoic
imperturbability.</em></span>But it is of the essence of his character
that this softer side is concealed behind an imperturbability
of outward demeanour that belongs to his stoic religion:
this struggle between inward and outward is the main feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>for the actor to bring out.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
14.</span>It is a master stroke of Shakespeare
that he utilises the euphuistic prose of his age to
express impassiveness in Brutus's oration. The greatest
of the world has just been assassinated; the mob are
swaying with fluctuating passions; the subtlest orator of his
day is at hand to turn those passions into the channel of
vengeance for his friend: Brutus called on amid such surroundings
to speak for the conspirators still maintains the
artificial style of carefully balanced sentences, such as
emotionless rhetoric builds up in the quiet of a study.</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>As Cæsar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice
at it; as he was valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I slew
him. There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his
valour; and death for his ambition.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The antithesis
reappears
for
Brutus in
the action.</em></div>

<p>Brutus's nature then is developed on all its sides; in his
character the antithesis of the outer and inner life disappears.
It reappears, however, in the action;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 10-85.</span>for Brutus is compelled
to balance a weighty issue, with public policy on the one
side, and on the other, not only justice to individual claims,
but further the claims of friendship, which is one of the
fairest flowers of the inner life. And the balance dips to
the wrong side. If the question were of using the
weapon of assassination against a criminal too high for
the ordinary law to reach, this would be a moral problem
which, however doubtful to modern thought, would have
been readily decided by a Stoic. But the question which
presented itself to Brutus was distinctly not this.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 18-34.</span>Shakespeare
has been careful to represent Brutus as admitting to
himself that Cæsar has done no wrong: he slays him <em>for
what he might do</em>.</p>

<div class="i0">And kill him in the shell.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is true that Shakespeare, with his usual 'dramatic hedging,'
softens down this immoral bias in a great hero by representing
him as both a Roman, of the nation which beyond all
other nations exalted the state over the individual, and a
Brutus, <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> ii. 159.</span>representative of the house which had risen to greatness
by leading violence against tyranny. But, Brutus's own
conscience being judge, the man against whom he moves is
guiltless; and so the conscious sacrifice of justice and friendship
to policy is a fatal error which is source sufficient for the
whole tragedy of which Brutus is the hero.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Cæsar: discrepancies
in his character
to be
reconciled.</em></div>

<p>The character of Cæsar is one of the most difficult in
Shakespeare. Under the influence of some of his speeches
we find ourselves in the presence of one of the master spirits
of mankind; other scenes in which he plays a leading part
breathe nothing but the feeblest vacillation and weakness.
It is the business of Character-Interpretation to harmonise
this contradiction; it is not interpretation at all to ignore one
side of it and be content with describing Cæsar as vacillating.
The force and strength of his character is seen in the impression
he makes upon forceful and strong men. The
attitude of Brutus to Cæsar seems throughout to be that of
looking up; and notably at one point the thought of Cæsar's
greatness seems to cast a lurid gleam over the assassination
plot itself, and Brutus feels that the grandeur of the victim
gives a dignity to the crime:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 173.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
The strength and force of Antony again no one will question;
and Antony, at the moment when he is alone with the
corpse of Cæsar and can have no motive for hypocrisy,
apostrophises it in the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 256.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</div>
<div class="i0">That ever lived in the tide of times.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And we see enough of Cæsar in the play to bear out the
opinions of Brutus and Antony. Those who accept vacillation
as sufficient description of Cæsar's character must explain
his strong speeches as vaunting and self-assertion. But
surely it must be possible for dramatic language to distinguish
between the true and the assumed force; and equally surely
there is a genuine ring in the speeches in which Cæsar's
heroic spirit, shut out from the natural sphere of action in
which it has been so often proved, leaps restlessly at every
opportunity into pregnant words. We may thus feel certain
of his lofty physical courage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 32.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>A man must have felt the thrill of courage in search of its
food, danger, before his self-assertion finds language of this
kind in which to express itself. In another scene we have
the perfect <em>fortiter in re</em> and <em>suaviter in modo</em> of the trained
statesman exhibited in the courtesy with which Cæsar receives
the conspirators, <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii, from

<div class="i0">Will he be satisfied.</div>

<p>Commonplace authority loudly proclaims that it will never
relent: the true imperial spirit feels it a preliminary condition
to see first that it never does wrong.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Reconciliation:
Cæsar the
highest
type of the
practical;</em></div>

<p>It is the antithesis of the outer and inner life that explains
this contradiction in Cæsar's character. Like Macbeth, he is
the embodiment of one side and one side only of the antithesis;
he is the complete type of the practical&mdash;though in
special qualities he is as unlike Macbeth as his age is unlike
Macbeth's age. Accordingly Cæsar appears before us perfect
up to the point where his own personality comes in. The
military and political spheres, in which he has been such a
colossal figure, call forth practical powers, and do not involve
introspection and meditation on foundation principles
of thought.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Theirs not to reason why:</div>
<div class="i0">Theirs but to do.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tasks of the soldier and the statesman are imposed upon
them by external authority and necessities, and the faculties
exercised are those which shape means to ends. But at last
Cæsar comes to a crisis that does involve his personality; he
attempts a task imposed on him by his own ambition. He
plays in a game of which the prize is the world and the
stake himself, and to estimate chances in such a game tests
self-knowledge and self-command to its depths.
<span class="sidenote"><em>but lacking
in the inner
life.</em></span>How wanting
Cæsar is in the cultivation of the inner life is brought out
by his contrast with Cassius.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 100-128.</span>The incidents of the flood and
the fever, retained by the memory of Cassius, illustrate this.
The first of these was no mere swimming-match; the flood
in the Tiber was such as to reduce to nothing the difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>between one swimmer and another.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 102.</span>It was a trial of nerve:
and as long as action was possible Cæsar was not only as
brave as Cassius, but was the one attracted by the danger.
Then some chance wave or cross current renders his chance
of life hopeless, and no buffeting with lusty sinews is of any
avail; that is the point at which the <em>passive</em> courage born of
the inner life comes in, and gives strength to submit to the
inevitable in calmness. This Cæsar lacks, and he calls for
rescue: Cassius would have felt the water close over him and
have sunk to the bottom and died rather than accept aid from
his rival. In like manner the sick bed is a region in which
the highest physical and intellectual activity is helpless; the
trained self-control of a Stoic may have a sphere for exercise
even here; but the god Cæsar shakes, and cries for drink
like a sick girl. <span class="sidenote"><em>The conception
brought out
by personal
contact
with
Cassius.</em></span>It is interesting to note how the two types
of mind, when brought into personal contact, jar upon one
another's self-consciousness. The intellectual man, judging
the man of action by the test of mutual intercourse, sees
nothing to explain the other's greatness, and wonders what
people find in him that they so admire him and submit to his
influence. On the other hand, the man of achievement is
uneasily conscious of a sort of superiority in one whose intellectual
aims and habits he finds it so difficult to follow&mdash;yet
superiority it is not, for what has he <em>done</em>?
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 182-214.</span>Shakespeare has
illustrated this in the play by contriving to bring Cæsar and
his suite across the 'public place' in which Cassius is discoursing
to Brutus. Cassius feels the usual irritation at
being utterly unable to find in his old acquaintance any
special qualities to explain his elevation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 148.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</div>
<div class="i0">Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,</div>
<div class="i0">That he is grown so great?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Similarly Cæsar, as he casts a passing glance at Cassius, becomes
at once uneasy. 'He thinks too much,' is the exclamation
of the man of action:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
<div class="i6">He loves no plays,</div>
<div class="i0">As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The practical man, accustomed to divide mankind into a few
simple types, is always uncomfortable at finding a man he
cannot classify. Finally there is a climax to the jealousy that
exists between the two lives: Cæsar complains that Cassius
'<em>looks quite through the deeds of men.</em>'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>A change in
Cæsar and
a change in
Rome itself.</em></div>
<div class="sidenote">
comp. <strong>i.</strong> i,
and <strong>iii.</strong> iii;
<strong>i.</strong> ii. 151,
164; <strong>i.</strong> iii.
82, 105;
<strong>iii.</strong> i. 66-70;
<strong>v.</strong> v.
69-72, &amp;c.</div>

<p>There is another circumstance to be taken into account in
explaining the weakness of Cæsar. A change has come over
the spirit of Roman political life itself&mdash;such seems to be
Shakespeare's conception: Cæsar on his return has found
Rome no longer the Rome he had known. Before he left
for Gaul, Rome had been the ideal sphere for public life, the
arena in which principles alone were allowed to combat, and
from which the banishment of personal aims and passions
was the first condition of virtue. In his absence Rome has
gradually degenerated; the mob has become the ruling force,
and introduced an element of uncertainty into political life;
politics has passed from science into gambling. A new order
of public men has arisen, of which Cassius and Antony are
the types; personal aims, personal temptations, and personal
risks are now inextricably interwoven with public action.
This is a changed order of things to which the mind of
Cæsar, cast in a higher mould, lacks the power to adapt itself.
His vacillation is the vacillation of unfamiliarity with
the new political conditions.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 230.</span>He refuses the crown 'each time
gentler than the other,' showing want of decisive reading in
dealing with the fickle mob;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 183.</span>and on his return from the
Capitol he is too untrained in hypocrisy to conceal the angry
spot upon his face; he has tried to use the new weapons
which he does not understand, and has failed.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 195.</span>It is a subtle
touch of Shakespeare's to the same effect that Cæsar is represented
as having himself undergone a change <em>of late</em>:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">For he is superstitious grown of late,</div>
<div class="i0">Quite from the main opinion he held once</div>
<div class="i0">Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>

To come back to a world of which you have mastered the
machinery, and to find that it is no longer governed by
machinery at all, that causes no longer produce their effects&mdash;this,
if anything, might well drive a strong intellect to superstition.
And herein consists the pathos of Cæsar's situation.
The deepest tragedy of the play is not the assassination of
Cæsar, it is rather seen in such a speech as this of Decius:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 202.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">If he be so resolved,</div>
<div class="i0">I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear</div>
<div class="i0">That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</div>
<div class="i0">And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</div>
<div class="i0">Lions with toils and men with flatterers;</div>
<div class="i0">But when I tell him, he hates flatterers,</div>
<div class="i0">He says he does, being then most flattered.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Assassination is a less piteous thing than to see the giant
intellect by its very strength unable to contend against the
low cunning of a fifth-rate intriguer.</p>

<p>Such, then, appears to be Shakespeare's conception of
Julius Cæsar. He is the consummate type of the practical:
emphatically the public man, complete in all the greatness
that belongs to action. On the other hand, the knowledge
of self produced by self-contemplation is wanting, and
so when he comes to consider the relation of his individual
self to the state he vacillates with the vacillation of a strong
man moving amongst men of whose greater intellectual
subtlety he is dimly conscious: no unnatural conception for a
Cæsar who has been founding empires abroad while his
fellows have been sharpening their wits in the party contests
of a decaying state.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Cassius:
his whole
character
developed
and subjected
to a
master-passion
that is disinterested.</em></div>

<p>The remaining members of the group are Cassius and
Antony. In Cassius thought and action have been equally
developed, and he has the qualities belonging to both
the outer and the inner life. But the side which in Brutus
barely preponderated, absolutely tyrannises in Cassius; his
public life has given him a grand passion to which the whole
of his nature becomes subservient. Inheriting a 'rash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>humour' from his mother, he was specially prepared for impatience
of political anomalies;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 120.</span>republican independence has
become to him an ideal dearer than life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 95.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii, iii; <strong>ii.</strong>
i; <strong>iii.</strong> i.
177, &amp;c.</div>

<p>He has thus become a professional politician. Politics is to
him a game, and men are counters to be used;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 312-319.</span>Cassius finds
satisfaction in discovering that even Brutus's 'honourable
metal may be wrought from that it is disposed.' He has the
politician's low view of human nature; while Brutus talks of
principles Cassius interposes appeals to interest: he says to
Antony,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 177.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Your voice shall be as strong as any man's</div>
<div class="i0">In the disposing of new dignities.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>His party spirit is, as usual, unscrupulous; he seeks to
work upon his friend's unsuspecting nobility by concocted
letters thrown in at his windows;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 319.</span> in the Quarrel Scene
loses patience at Brutus's scruples.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 7,

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">Older in practice, abler than yourself</div>
<div class="i0">To make conditions.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the same time he has a party politician's tact; his advice
throughout the play is proved by the event to have been
right,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 145.</span>and he does himself no more than justice when he says
his misgiving 'still falls shrewdly to the purpose.'
<span class="sidenote"><em>Antony:
his whole
character
developed
and subjected
to
selfish
passion.</em></span>Antony
also has all the powers that belong both to the intellectual
and practical life; so far as these powers are concerned, he
has them developed to a higher degree than even Brutus and
Cassius. His distinguishing mark lies in the use to which
these powers are put; like Cassius, he has concentrated his
whole nature in one aim, but this aim is not a disinterested
object of public good, it is unmitigated self-seeking. Antony
has greatness enough to appreciate the greatness of Cæsar;
hence in the first half of the play he has effaced himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>choosing to rise to power as the useful tool of Cæsar.
<span class="sidenote">esp. <strong>i.</strong> ii,
from 190;
comp. <strong>ii.</strong> i.
165.</span>Here,
indeed, he is famed as a devotee of the softer studies, but
it is not till his patron has fallen that his irresistible strength
is put forth. There seems to be but one element in Antony
that is not selfish:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i, from
254; comp.
194-213.</span>his attachment to Cæsar is genuine, and
its force is measured in the violent imagery of the vow with
which, when alone for a moment with the corpse, he promises
vengeance till all pity is 'choked with custom of fell deeds.'
And yet this perhaps is after all the best illustration of his
callousness to higher feelings; for the one tender emotion of
his heart is used by him as the convenient weapon with which
to fight his enemies and raise himself to power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Grouping
as a
whole surveyed.</em></div>

<p>Such, then, is the Grouping of Characters in the play of
<em>Julius Cæsar</em>. To catch it they must be contemplated in the
light of the antithesis between the outer and inner life. In
Brutus the antithesis disappears amid the perfect balancing
of his character, to reappear in the action, when Brutus has
to choose between his cause and his friend. In Cæsar the
practical life only is developed, and he fails as soon as action
involves the inner life. Cassius has the powers of both outer
and inner life perfect, and they are fused into one master-passion,
morbid but unselfish. Antony has carried to an even
greater perfection the culture of both lives, and all his powers
are concentrated in one purpose, which is purely selfish. In
the action in which this group of personages is involved the
determining fact is the change that has come over the spirit
of Roman life, and introduced into its public policy the
element of personal aggrandisement and personal risk. The
new spirit works upon Brutus: the chance of winning
political liberty by the assassination of one individual just
overbalances his moral judgment, and he falls. Yet in his fall
he is glorious: the one false judgment of his life brings him,
what is more to him than victory, the chance of maintaining
the calmness of principle amid the ruins of a falling cause,
and showing how a Stoic can fail and die. The new spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>affects Cæsar and tempts him into a personal enterprise in
which success demands a meanness that he lacks, and he is
betrayed to his fall. Yet in his fall he is glorious: the assassins'
daggers purge him from the stain of his momentary
personal ambition, and the sequel shows that the Roman
world was not worthy of a ruler such as Cæsar. The spirit
of the age effects Cassius, and fans his passion to work itself
out to his own destruction, and he falls. Yet in his fall he is
glorious: we forgive him the lowered tone of his political
action when we see by the spirit of the new rulers how
desperate was the chance for which he played, and how
Cassius and his loved cause of republican freedom expire
together. The spirit of the age which has wrought upon the
rest is controlled and used by Antony, and he rises on their
ruins. Yet in his rise he is less glorious than they in their
fall: he does all for self; he may claim therefore the prize
of success, but in goodness he has no share beyond that
he is permitted to be the passive instrument of punishing
evil.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">How the Play of Julius Cæsar works
to a Climax at the centre.</span></p>

<p class="right"><em>A Study in Passion and Movement.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Passion
and Movement
as
elements of
dramatic
effect.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">THE preceding chapters have been confined to two of
the main elements in dramatic effect, Character and
Plot: the third remains to be illustrated. Amongst other
devices of public amusement the experiment has been tried
of arranging a game of chess to be played by living pieces
on a monster board; if we suppose that in the midst of such
a game the real combative instincts of the living pieces should
be suddenly aroused, that the knight should in grim earnest
plunge his spear into his nearest opponent, and that missiles
should actually be discharged from the castles, then the
shock produced in the feelings of the bystanders by such
a change would serve to bring out with emphasis the distinction
between Plot and the third element of dramatic
effect, Passion. Plot is an interest of a purely intellectual
kind, it traces laws, principles, order, and design in the
incidents of life. Passion, on the other hand, depends on the
human character of the personages involved; it consists in
the effects produced on the spectator's emotional nature as
his sympathy follows the characters through the incidents of
the plot; it is War as distinguished from <em>Kriegspiel</em>. Effects
of such Passion are numerous and various: the present study
is concerned with its <em>Movement</em>. This Movement comprehends
a class of dramatic effects differing in one obvious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>particular from the effects considered so far. Character-Interpretation
and Plot are both analytical in their nature;
the play has to be taken to pieces and details selected from
various parts have to be put together to give the idea of a
complete character, or to make up some single thread of
design. <span class="sidenote"><em>Passion
connected
with the
movement
of a drama.</em></span>Movement, on the contrary, follows the actual order
of the events as they take place in the play itself. The
emotional effects produced by such events as they succeed
one another will not be uniform and monotonous; the skill
of the dramatist will lie in concentrating effect at some points
and relieving it at others; and to watch such play of passion
through the progress of the action will be a leading dramatic
interest. Now we have already had occasion to notice the
prominence which Shakespeare in his dramatic construction
gives to the central point of a play; symmetry more than
sensation is the effect which has an attraction for his genius,
and the finale to which the action is to lead is not more important
to him than the balancing of the whole drama about
a turning-point in the middle. Accordingly it is not surprising
to find that in the Passion-Movement of his dramas a similar
plan of construction is often followed; that all other variations
are subordinated to one great Climax of Passion at the
centre. <span class="sidenote"><em>The
regular
arch-form
applicable
to Passion-Movement.</em></span>To repeat an illustration already applied to Plot: the
movement of the passion seems to follow the form of a
regular arch, commencing in calmness, rising through
emotional strain to a summit of agitation at the centre, then
through the rest of the play declining into a calmness of a
different kind. It is the purpose of the two remaining studies
to illustrate this kind of movement in two very different
plays. <em>Julius Cæsar</em> has the simplest of plots; our attention
is engaged with a train of emotion which is made to rise
gradually to a climax at the centre, and then equally
gradually to decline. <em>Lear</em>, on the contrary, is amongst the
most intricate of Shakespeare's plays; nevertheless the
dramatist contrives to keep the same simple form of emotional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>effect, and its complex passions unite in producing a concentration
of emotional agitation in a few central scenes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>In Julius
Cæsar the
movement
follows the
justification
of the
conspirators
to the audience:</em></div>

<p>The passion in the play of <em>Julius Cæsar</em> gathers around
the conspirators, and follows them through the mutations of
their fortunes. If however we are to catch the different parts
of the action in their proper proportions we must remember
the character of these conspirators, and especially of their
leaders Brutus and Cassius. These are actuated in what
they do not by personal motives but by devotion to the
public good and the idea of republican liberty; accordingly
in following their career we must not look too exclusively at
their personal success and failure. The exact key to the
movement of the drama will be given by fixing attention
upon <em>the justification of the conspirators' cause</em> in the minds of
the audience; <span class="sidenote"><em>this rises to
the centre
and declines
from
the centre.</em></span>and it is this which is found to rise gradually
to its height in the centre of the play, and from that point to
decline to the end. I have pointed out in the preceding
study how the issue at stake in <em>Julius Cæsar</em> amounts to a
conflict between the outer and inner life, between devotion
to a public enterprise and such sympathy with the claims of
individual humanity as is specially fostered by the cultivation
of the inner nature. The issue is reflected in words of
Brutus already quoted:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 18.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</div>
<div class="i0">Remorse from power.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Brutus applies this as a test to Cæsar's action, and is forced
to acquit him: but is not Brutus here laying down the very
principle of which his own error in the play is the violation?
The assassin's dagger puts Brutus and the conspirators in
the position of power; while 'remorse'&mdash;the word in Shakespearean
English means human sympathy&mdash;is the due of
their victim Cæsar, whose rights to justice as a man, and to
more than justice as the friend of Brutus, the conspirators
have the responsibility of balancing against the claims of a
political cause. These claims of justice and humanity are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>deliberately ignored by the stoicism of Brutus, while the rest
of the conspirators are blinded to them by the mists of
political enthusiasm; this outraged human sympathy asserts
itself after Cæsar's death in a monstrous form in the passions
of the mob, which are guided by the skill of Antony to the
destruction of the assassins. Of course both the original
violation of the balance between the two lives and the
subsequent reaction are equally corrupt. The stoicism of
Brutus, with its suppression of the inner sympathies, arrives
practically at the principle&mdash;destined in the future history of
the world to be the basis of a yet greater crime&mdash;that it is
expedient that one man should die rather than that a whole
people should perish. On the other hand, Antony trades upon
the fickle violence of the populace, and uses it as much for
personal ends as for vengeance. This demoralisation of both
the sides of character is the result of their divorce. Such is
the essence of this play if its action be looked at as a whole;
but it belongs to the movement of dramatic passion that we
see the action only in its separate parts at different times.
Through the first half of the play, while the justification of
the conspirators' cause is rising, the other side of the question
is carefully hidden from us; from the point of the assassination
the suppressed element starts into prominence, and
sweeps our sympathies along with it to its triumph at the
conclusion of the play.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>First stage:
the conspiracy
forming.
Passion
indistinguishable
from mere
interest.</em></div>

<p>In following the movement of the drama the action seems
to divide itself into stages. In the first of these stages, which
comprehends the first two scenes, the conspiracy is only
forming; the sympathy with which the spectator follows the
details is entirely free from emotional agitation; passion so
far is indistinguishable from mere interest.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i, ii.</span>The opening
scene strikes appropriately the key-note of the whole action.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Starting-point:
signs
of reaction
in the popular
worship of
Cæsar.</em></span>In it we see the tribunes of the people&mdash;officers whose whole
<em>raison d'être</em> is to be the mouthpiece of the commonalty&mdash;restraining
their own clients from the noisy honours they are disposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>to pay to Cæsar.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i.</span>To the justification in our eyes of a
conspiracy against Cæsar, there could not be a better starting-point
than this hint that the popular worship of Cæsar,
which has made him what he is, is itself reaching its
reaction-point. Such a suggestion moreover makes the
whole play one complete <em>wave</em> of popular fickleness from
crest to crest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Rise
begins. The
cause seen
at its best,
the victim
at his
worst.</em></div>

<p>The second is the scene upon which the dramatist mainly
relies for the <em>crescendo</em> in the justification of the conspirators.
It is a long scene, elaborately contrived so as to
keep the conspirators and their cause before us at their very
best, and the victim at his very worst.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii.</span>Cassius is the life
and spirit of this scene, as he is of the whole republican
movement. Cassius is excellent soil for republican principles.
The 'rash humour' his mother gave him would predispose
him to impatience of those social inequalities and conventional
distinctions against which republicanism sets itself.
Again he is a hard-thinking man, to whom the perfect
realisation of an ideal theory would be as palpable an aim as
the more practical purposes of other men. He is a Roman
moreover, at once proud of his nation as the greatest in the
world, and aware that this national greatness had been
through all history bound up with the maintenance of a
republican constitution. His republicanism gives to Cassius
the dignity that is always given to a character by a grand
passion, whether for a cause, a woman, or an idea&mdash;the
unification of a whole life in a single aim, by which the
separate strings of a man's nature are, as it were, tuned into
harmony. In the present scene Cassius is expounding the
cause which is his life-object. Nor is this all. Cassius was
politician enough to adapt himself to his hearers, and could
hold up the lower motives to those who would be influenced
by them; but in the present case it is the 'honourable metal'
of a Brutus that he has to work upon, and his exposition
of republicanism must be adapted to the highest possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>standard. Accordingly, in the language of the scene we find
the idea of human equality expressed in its most ideal form.
Without it Cassius thinks life not worth living.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 95.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I had as lief not be as live to be</div>

<div class="i0">I was born free as Cæsar; so were you;</div>
<div class="i0">We both have fed as well, and we can both</div>
<div class="i0">Endure the winter's cold as well as he.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The examples follow of the flood and fever incidents, which
show how the majesty of Cæsar vanished before the violence
of natural forces and the prostration of disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">115.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">A wretched creature and must bend his body,</div>
<div class="i0">If Cæsar carelessly but nod on him.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the eye of the state, individuals are so many members of a
class, in precisely the way that their names are so many
examples of the proper noun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">142.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Brutus and Cæsar: what should be in that 'Cæsar'?</div>

<div class="i0">Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,</div>
<div class="i0">That he is grown so great?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And this exposition of the conspirators' cause in its highest
form is at the same time thrown into yet higher relief by a
background to the scene, in which the victim is presented at
his worst. <span class="sidenote">from 182.</span>All through the conversation between Brutus and
Cassius, the shouting of the mob reminds of the scene which
is at the moment going on in the Capitol, while the conversation
is interrupted for a time by the returning procession of
Cæsar. In this action behind the scenes which thus mingles
with the main incident Cæsar is committing the one fault of
his life: this is the fault of 'treason,' which can be justified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>only by being successful and so becoming 'revolution,'
whereas Cæsar is failing, and deserving to fail from the
vacillating hesitation with which he sins. Moreover, unfavourable
as such incidents would be in themselves to our
sympathy with Cæsar, yet it is not the actual facts that we
are permitted to see, but they are further distorted by
the medium through which they reach us&mdash;the cynicism of
Casca which belittles and disparages all he relates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 235.</div>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p><em>Bru.</em> Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</p>

<p><em>Casca.</em> I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it: it was mere
foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown;&mdash;yet
'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets:&mdash;and, as I
told you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would
fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by
again: but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
And then he offer'd it the third time; he put it the third time by: and
still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped
hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of
stinking breath because Cæsar had refused the crown that it had almost
choked Cæsar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and, for mine own
part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the
bad air.... When he came to himself again, he said, If he had done or
said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his
infirmity. Three or four wenches, where I stood, cried, 'Alas, good
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts; but there's no heed to be
taken of them; if Cæsar had stabbed their mothers they would have
done no less.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Second
stage: the
conspiracy
formed and
developing.
Passion-Strain
begins.</em></div>

<p>At the end of the scene Brutus is won, and we pass
immediately into the second stage of the action: the conspiracy
is now formed and developing, and the emotional
strain begins. The adhesion of Brutus has given us confidence
that the conspiracy will be effective, and we have
only to <em>wait</em> for the issue.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii&mdash;<strong>ii.</strong> ii.</span>This mere notion of <em>waiting</em> is
itself enough to introduce an element of agitation into the
passion sufficient to mark off this stage of the action from
the preceding. <span class="sidenote"><em>Suspense
one element
in the
strain of
passion.</em></span>How powerful suspense is for this purpose we
have expressed in the words of the play itself:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 63.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Between the acting of a dreadful thing</div>
<div class="i0">And the first motion, all the interim is</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
<div class="i0">Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:</div>
<div class="i0">The Genius and the mortal instruments</div>
<div class="i0">Are then in council; and the state of man,</div>
<div class="i0">Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</div>
<div class="i0">The nature of an insurrection.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The background
of
tempest
and supernatural
portents a
device for
increasing
the strain.</em></div>

<p>But besides the suspense there is a special device for
securing the agitation proper to this stage of the passion:
throughout there is maintained a Dramatic Background of
night, storm, and supernatural portents.</p>

<p>The conception of nature as exhibiting sympathy with
sudden turns in human affairs is one of the most fundamental
instincts of poetry. To cite notable instances:
it is this which accompanies with storm and whirlwind the
climax to the <em>Book of Job</em>, and which leads Milton to make
the whole universe sensible of Adam's transgression:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again</div>
<div class="i0">In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan;</div>
<div class="i0">Sky lowr'd, and muttering thunder, some sad drops</div>
<div class="i0">Wept at completing of the mortal sin</div>
<div class="i0">Original.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So too the other end of the world's history has its appropriate
accompaniments: 'the sun shall be darkened and the moon
shall not give her light, and the stars shall be falling from
heaven.' There is a <em>vagueness</em> of terror inseparable from
these outbursts of nature, so mysterious in their causes and
aims. They are actually the most mighty of forces&mdash;for
human artillery is feeble beside the earthquake&mdash;yet they are
invisible: the wind works its havoc without the keenest eye
being able to perceive it, and the lightning is never seen till
it has struck. Again, there is something weird in the feeling
that the most frightful powers in the material universe are all
<em>soft things</em>. The empty air becomes the irresistible wind;
the fluid and yielding water wears down the hard and
massive rock and determines the shape of the earth; impalpable
fire that is blown about in every direction can be
roused till it devours the solidest constructions of human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>skill; while the most powerful agencies of all, electricity and
atomic force, are imperceptible to any of the senses and are
known only by their results. This uncanny terror attaching
to the union between force and softness is the inspiration of
one of Homer's most unique episodes, in which the bewildered
Achilles, struggling with the river-god, finds the
strength and skill of the finished warrior vain against the
ever-rising water, and bitterly feels the violation of the
natural order&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That strong might fall by strong, where now weak water's luxury</div>
<div class="i0">Must make my death blush.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii; <strong>ii.</strong>
ii, &amp;c.</div>

<p>To the terrible in nature are added portents of the supernatural,
sudden violations of the uniformity of nature, the
principle upon which all science is founded. The solitary
bird of night has been seen in the crowded Capitol; fire has
played around a human hand without destroying it; lions,
forgetting their fierceness, have mingled with men; clouds
drop fire instead of rain; graves are giving up their dead;
the chance shapes of clouds take distinctness to suggest
tumult on the earth. Such phenomena of nature and the
supernatural, agitating from their appeal at once to fear and
mystery, and associated by the fancy with the terrible in
human events, have made a deep impression upon primitive
thought; and the impression has descended by generations
of inherited tradition until, whatever may be the attitude of
the intellect to the phenomena themselves, their associations
in the emotional nature are of agitation. They thus become
appropriate as a Dramatic Background to an agitated passion
in the scenes themselves, calling out the emotional effect by
a vague sympathy, much as a musical note may set in vibration
a distant string that is in unison with it.</p>

<p>This device then is used by Shakespeare in the second
stage of the present play. We see the warning terrors
through the eyes of men of the time, and their force is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>measured by the fact that they shake the cynical Casca into
eloquence.</p>

<p>And the idea thus started at the commencement is kept
before our minds throughout this stage of the drama by
perpetual allusions, however slight, to the sky and external
nature. <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>ii.</strong> i. 44,
101, 198,
221, 263;
<strong>ii.</strong> ii.</span>Brutus reads the secret missives by the light of
exhalations whizzing through the air; when some of the
conspirators step aside, to occupy a few moments while the
rest are conferring apart, it is to the sky their thoughts
naturally seem to turn, and they with difficulty can make out
the East from the West; the discussion of the conspirators
includes the effect on Cæsar of the night's prodigies. Later
Portia remonstrates against her husband's exposure to the
raw and dank morning, to the rheumy and unpurged air;
even when daylight has fully returned, the conversation is of
Calpurnia's dream and the terrible prodigies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii.</div>

<p>Against this background are displayed, first single figures
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 1-85.</span>of Cassius and other conspirators;
then Brutus alone in calm
deliberation:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 86-228.</span>then the whole band of conspirators, their wild
excitement side by side with Brutus's immovable moderation.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, from
233.</span>Then the Conspiracy Scene fades in the early morning light
into a display of Brutus in his softer relations;
and with
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii.</span>complete return of day changes to the house of Cæsar on
the fatal morning. Cæsar also is displayed in contact with
the supernatural, as represented by Calpurnia's terrors and
repeated messages of omens that forbid his venturing upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>public action for that day.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Cæsar still
seen at a
disadvantage;</em></span>Cæsar faces all this with his
usual loftiness of mind; yet the scene is so contrived that, as
far as immediate effect is concerned, this very loftiness is
made to tell against him. The unflinching courage that
overrides and interprets otherwise the prodigies and warnings
seems presumption to us who know the reality of the danger.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 8-56.</span>It is the same with his yielding to the humour of his wife.
Why should he not? his is not the conscious weakness that
must be firm to show that it is not afraid. Yet when, upon
Decius's explaining away the dream and satisfying Calpurnia's
fears, Cæsar's own attraction to danger leads him to
persevere in his first intention, this change of purpose seems
to us,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 202.</span>who have heard Decius's boast that he can o'ersway
Cæsar with flattery, a confirmation of Cæsar's weakness. So
in accordance with the purpose that reigns through the first
half of the play the victim is made to appear at his worst:
the <em>passing</em> effect of the scene is to suggest weakness in
Cæsar, while it is in fact furnishing elements which, upon
reflection, go to build up a character of strength.
<span class="sidenote"><em>and the
justification
of the

rising.</em></span>On the
other hand, throughout this stage the justification of the

tone; in particular by the way in which they interpret to
their own advantage the supernatural element.

<div class="sidenote"><em>Third
stage. The
Crisis: the
passion-strain
rises
to a Climax.</em></div>

<p>The third stage of the action brings us to the climax of
the passion; the strain upon our emotions now rises to a
height of agitation. The exact commencement of the crisis
seems to be marked by the soothsayer's words at the opening
of Act III. <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii&mdash;<strong>iii.</strong>
i. 121.</span>Cæsar observes on entering the Capitol the
soothsayer who had warned him to beware of this very
day.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Cæsar.</em> The ides of March are come.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Sooth.</em> Ay, Cæsar; but not gone.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such words seem to measure out a narrow area of time in
which the crisis is to work itself out. There is however no
distinct break between different stages of a dramatic movement
like that in the present play; <span class="sidenote"><em>Devices for
working
up the agitation.</em></span>and two short incidents
have preceded this scene which have served as emotional
devices to bring about a distinct advance in the intensification
of the strain. <span class="sidenote"><em>Artemidorus</em>;
<strong>ii.</strong> iii. and
<strong>iii.</strong> i. 3.</span>In the first, Artemidorus appeared reading
a letter of warning which he purposed to present to Cæsar
on his way to the fatal spot. In the Capitol Scene he presents
it, while the ready Decius hastens to interpose another
petition to take off Cæsar's attention. Artemidorus conjures
Cæsar to read his first for 'it touches him nearer'; but the
imperial chivalry of Cæsar forbids:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What touches us ourself shall be last served.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Portia;</em>
<strong>ii.</strong> iv.</div>

<p>The momentary hope of rescue is dashed. In the second
incident Portia has been displayed completely unnerved by
the weight of a secret to the anxiety of which she is not
equal; she sends messengers to the Capitol and recalls
them as she recollects that she dare give them no message;
her agitation has communicated itself to us, besides
suggesting the fear that it may betray to others what she is
anxious to conceal. Our sympathy has thus been tossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>from side to side, although in its general direction it still
moves on the side of the conspirators.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Popilius
Lena.</em></span>In the crisis itself
the agitation becomes painful as the entrance of Popilius
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 13.</span>Lena and his secret communication to Cæsar cause a panic
that threatens to wreck the whole plot on the verge of its
success. Brutus's nerve sustains even this trial, and the way
for the accomplishment of the deed is again clear. Emotional
devices like these have carried the passion up to a climax of
agitation; and the conspirators now advance to present
their pretended suit and achieve the bloody deed. To the
last the double effect of Cæsar's demeanour continues.
Considered in itself, his unrelenting firmness of principle
exhibits the highest model of a ruler; yet to us, who know
the purpose lurking behind the hypocritical intercession of
the conspirators, Cæsar's self-confidence resembles the infatuation
that goes before Nemesis. <span class="sidenote">from 58.</span>He scorns the fickle
politicians before him as mere wandering sparks of heavenly
fire, while he is left alone as a pole-star of true-fixed and
resting quality:&mdash;and in answer to his presumptuous boast
that he can never be moved come the blows of the assassins
which strike him down; <span class="sidenote">compare
115.</span>while there is a flash of irony as he
is seen to have fallen beside the statue of Pompey, and the
marble seems to gleam in cold triumph over the rival at last
lying bleeding at its feet. The assassination is accomplished,
the cause of the conspirators is won: pity notwithstanding
we are swept along with the current of their enthusiasm;
<span class="sidenote"><em>The justification
at
its height
in the appeal
to all
time.</em></span>and the justification that has been steadily rising from the
commencement reaches its climax as, their adversaries dispersing
in terror, the conspirators dip their hands in their
victim's blood, and make their triumphant appeal to the
whole world and all time.</p>

<p><em>Enter a servant:</em> this simple stage-direction is the

<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i, from

of Antony who speaks, yet the first words of his message
ring with the peculiar tone of subtly-poised sentences
which are inseparably associated with Antony's eloquence;
it is like the first announcement of that which is to be a final
theme in music, and from this point this tone dominates the
scene to the very end.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In the whole Shakespearean Drama there is nowhere such a
swift swinging round of a dramatic action as is here marked
by this sudden up-springing of the suppressed individuality
in Antony's character,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 165.</span>hitherto so colourless that he has
been spared by the conspirators as a mere limb of Cæsar.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 144.</span>The tone of exultant triumph in the conspirators has in an
instant given place to Cassius's 'misgiving' as Brutus grants
Antony an audience;
<span class="sidenote">from 164.</span>and when Antony enters, Brutus's first
words to him fall into the form of apology. The quick
subtlety of Antony's intellect has grasped the whole situation,
and with irresistible force he slowly feels his way
towards using the conspirators' aid for crushing themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>and avenging their victim.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 211,
compare
177.</span>The bewilderment of the conspirators
in the presence of this unlooked-for force is seen
in Cassius's unavailing attempt to bring Antony to the point,
as to what compact he will make with them. Antony, on
the contrary, reads his men with such nicety that he can
indulge himself in sailing close to the wind,
<span class="sidenote">from 184.</span>and grasps
fervently the hands of the assassins while he pours out a
flood of bitter grief over the corpse. It is not hypocrisy,
nor a trick to gain time, this conciliation of his enemies.
Steeped in the political spirit of the age, Antony knows, as
no other man, the mob which governs Rome, and is conscious
of the mighty engine he possesses in his oratory to
sway that mob in what direction he pleases; when his bold
plan has succeeded, and his adversaries have consented to
meet him in contest of oratory, then ironical conciliation
becomes the natural relief to his pent-up passion.</p>

<div class="center">

<div class="i0"><em>Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons</em></div>
<div class="i0">Why and wherein Cæsar was dangerous.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is as he feels the sense of innate oratorical power and of
the opportunity his enemies have given to that power, that
he exaggerates his temporary amity with the men he is
about to crush: it is the executioner arranging his victim
comfortably on the rack before he proceeds to apply the
levers. Already the passion of the drama has fallen under
the guidance of Antony. The view of Cæsar as an innocent
victim is now allowed full play upon our sympathies
when Antony,
<span class="sidenote">from 254.</span>left alone with the corpse, can drop the
artificial mask and give vent to his love and vengeance.
<span class="sidenote">231-243.</span>The success of the conspiracy had begun to decline as we
marked Brutus's ill-timed generosity to Antony in granting
him the funeral oration;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from

unnatural euphuism of Brutus's speech in its defence;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii, from
78.</span>it is
hurried to its ruin when Antony at last exercises his spell
upon the Roman people and upon the reader. The speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>of Antony, with its mastery of every phase of feeling, is a
perfect sonata upon the instrument of the human emotions.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 78.</span>Its opening theme is sympathy with bereavement, against
which are working as if in conflict anticipations of future
themes, doubt and compunction.
<span class="sidenote">95, 109,
&amp;c.</span>A distinct change of
movement comes with the first introduction of what is to be
the final subject,
<span class="sidenote">133.</span>the mention of the will. But when this new
movement has worked up from curiosity to impatience,
<span class="sidenote">177.</span>there
is a diversion: the mention of the victory over the Nervii
turns the emotions in the direction of historic pride,
<span class="sidenote">178.</span>which
harmonises well with the opposite emotions roused as the
orator fingers hole after hole in Cæsar's mantle made by the
daggers of his false friends,
<span class="sidenote">200.</span>and so leads up to a sudden
shock when he uncovers the body itself and displays the
popular idol and its bloody defacement.
<span class="sidenote">243.</span>Then the finale
begins: the forgotten theme of the will is again started, and
from a burst of gratitude the passion quickens and intensifies
to rage, to fury, to mutiny.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The mob
won to the
Reaction.</em></span>The mob is won to the
Reaction;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii.</span>and the curtain that falls upon the third Act rises
for a moment to display the populace tearing a man to
pieces simply because he bears the same name as one of the
conspirators.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Last stage.
Development
of an
inevitable
fate: passion-strain
ceases.</em></div>

<p>The final stage of the action works out the development
of an inevitable fate. The emotional strain now ceases,
and, as in the first stage, the passion is of the calmer order,
the calmness in this case of pity balanced by a sense of
justice. From the opening of the fourth Act the decline in
the justification of the conspirators is intimated by the logic
of events. The first scene exhibits to us the triumvirate that
now governs Rome, and shows that in this triumvirate
Antony is supreme:
<span class="sidenote">Acts <strong>iv, v.</strong>
<strong>iv.</strong> i.</span>with the man who is the embodiment
of the Reaction thus appearing at the head of the world,
the fall of the conspirators is seen to be inevitable.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii. 3.</span>The
decline of our sympathy with them continues in the following
scenes. The Quarrel Scene shows how low the tone of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>Cassius has fallen since he has dealt with assassination as a
political weapon; and even Brutus's moderation has hardened
into unpleasing harshness.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 148,
&amp;c.</span>There is at this point
plenty of relief to such unpleasing effects:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. from
239.</span>there is the
exhibition of the tender side of Brutus's character as shown
in his relations with his page,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii.</span>and the display of friendship
maintained between Brutus and Cassius amid falling fortunes.
But such incidents as these have a different effect upon us
from that which they would have had at an earlier period;
the justification of the conspirators has so far declined that
now attractive touches in them serve only to increase the
pathos of a fate which, however, our sympathy no longer
seeks to resist.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 275.</span>We get a supernatural foreshadowing of the
end in the appearance to Brutus of Cæsar's Ghost,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i. 80.</span>and the
omen Cassius sees of the eagles that had consorted his army
to Philippi giving place to ravens, crows, and kites on the
morning of battle: this lends the authority of the invisible
world to our sense that the conspirators' cause is doomed.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 196-230.</span>And judicial blindness overtakes them as Brutus's authority
in council overweighs in point after point the shrewder
advice of Cassius. Through the scenes of the fifth Act we
see the republican leaders fighting on without hope.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Justification
entirely
vanishes
as the conspirators
recognise
Cæsar's
victory.</em></span>The
last remnant of justification for their cause ceases as the
conspirators themselves seem to acknowledge their error and
fate. Cassius as he feels his death-blow recognises the very
weapon with which he had committed the crime:</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">How Climax meets Climax in
the centre of Lear.</span></p>

<p class="right"><em>A Study in more complex
Passion and Movement.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The plot
of Lear
highly
complex</em>.</div>

<p class="dropcap">IN <em>Julius Cæsar</em> we have seen how, in the case of a very
simple play, a few simple devices are sufficient to produce
a regular rise and fall in the passion. We now turn to
a highly elaborate plot and trace how, notwithstanding the
elaborateness, a similar concentration of the passion in the
centre of the play can be secured. <em>King Lear</em> is one of the
most complex of Shakespeare's tragedies; its plot is made
up of a number of separate actions, with their combinations
accurately carried out, the whole impressing us with a sense
of artistic involution similar to that of an elaborate musical
fugue. Here, however, we are concerned only indirectly
with the plot of the play: we need review it no further than
may suffice to show what distinct interests enter into it, and
enable us to observe how the separate trains of passion work
toward a common climax at the centre.</p>

<p>Starting from the notion of pattern as a fundamental idea
we have seen how Plot presents trains of events in human
life taking form and shape as a crime and its nemesis, an
oracle and its fulfilment, the rise and fall of an individual, or
even as simply a story. <span class="sidenote"><em>The main
plot exhibits
the
Problem
form of dramatic
action.</em></span>The particular form of action underlying
the main plot of <em>King Lear</em> is different from any we
have yet noticed. It may be described as a <em>Problem Action</em>.
A mathematician in his problem assumes some unusual combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>of forces to have come about, and then proceeds to
trace its consequences: so the Drama often deals with
problems in history and life, setting up, before the commencement
of the play or early in the action, some peculiar
arrangement of moral relations, and then throughout the
rest of the action developing the consequences of these to the
personages involved. Thus the opening scene of <em>King Lear</em>
is occupied in bringing before us a pregnant and suggestive
state of affairs: imperiousness is represented as overthrowing
conscience and setting up an unnatural distribution of power.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The problem
stated.</em></span>A human problem has thus been enunciated which the remainder
of the play has to work out to its natural solution.</p>

<p>Imperiousness seems to be the term appropriate to Lear's
conduct in the first scene. This is no case of dotage dividing
an inheritance according to public declarations of affection.
The division had already been made according to
the best advice:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 3, &amp;c.</span>in the case of two of the daughters 'equalities
had been so weighed that curiosity in neither could
make choice of either's moiety'; and if the portion of the
youngest and best loved of the three was the richest, this
is a partiality natural enough to absolute power. The
opening scene of the play is simply the court ceremony in
which the formal transfer is to be made.
<span class="sidenote">38.</span>Lear is already
handing to his daughters the carefully drawn maps which
mark the boundaries of the provinces,
<span class="sidenote">49.</span>when he suddenly
pauses, and, with the yearning of age and authority for testimonies
of devotion, calls upon his daughters for declarations
of affection, the easiest of returns for the substantial gifts he
is giving them, and which Goneril and Regan pour forth
with glib eloquence.
<span class="sidenote">84.</span>Then Lear turns to Cordelia, and,
thinking delightedly of the special prize he has marked out
for the pet of his old age, asks her:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">What can you say to draw</div>
<div class="i0">A third more opulent than your sisters?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But Cordelia has been revolted by the fulsome flattery of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>sisters whose hypocrisy she knows so well, and she bluntly
refuses to be drawn into any declaration of affection at all.
Cordelia might well have found some other method of
separating herself from her false sisters, without thus flouting
her father before his whole court in a moment of tenderness
to herself; or, if carried away by the indignation of the
moment, a sign of submission would have won her a ready
pardon. <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> i. 131.</span>But Cordelia, sweet and strong as her character is
in great things, has yet inherited a touch of her father's
temper, and the moment's sullenness is protracted into obstinacy.
Cordelia then has committed an offence of manner;
Lear's passion vents itself in a sentence proper only to a
moral crime: now the punishment of a minute offence with
wholly disproportionate severity simply because it is an
offence against personal will is an exact description of imperiousness.</p>

<p>As Lear stands for imperiousness, so conscience is represented
by Kent, who, with the voice of authority derived
from lifelong intimacy and service, interposes to check the
King's passion in its headlong course.</p>

</div>
<p>In the banishment of this Kent, then, the resistance of Lear's
conscience is overcome, and his imperious passion has full
swing in transferring Cordelia's kingdom to her treacherous
sisters.</p>

<p>The opening scene has put before us, not in words but
figured in action, a problem in human affairs: the violation
of moral equity has set up an unnatural arrangement of
power&mdash;power taken from the good and lodged in the hands
of the bad. Here is, so to speak, a piece of moral unstable
equilibrium, and the rebound from it is to furnish the remainder
of the action. The very structure of the plot
corresponds with the simple structure of a scientific proposition.
The latter consists of two unequal parts: a few
lines are sufficient to enunciate the problem, while a whole
treatise may be required for its solution. So in <em>King Lear</em>
a single scene brings about the unnatural state of affairs, the
consequences of which it takes the rest of the play to trace.
The 'catastrophe,' or turning-point of the play at which the
ultimate issues are decided, appears in the present case, not
close to the end of the play, nor (as in <em>Julius Cæsar</em>) in the
centre, but close to the commencement: at the end of the
opening scene Lear's act of folly has in reality determined
the issue of the whole action; the scenes which follow are
only working out a determined issue to its full realisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The solution
of the
problem in
a triple
tragedy.</em></div>

<p>We have seen the problem itself, the overthrow of conscience
by imperiousness and the transfer of power from the
good to the bad: what is the solution of it as presented by
the incidents of the play? The consequences flowing from
what Lear has done make up three distinct tragedies, which
go on working side by side, and all of which are essential to
the full solution of the problem. First, there is the nemesis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>upon Lear himself&mdash;the double retribution of receiving nothing
but evil from those he has unrighteously rewarded, <span class="sidenote">(1) <em>Tragedy
of Lear.</em></span>
and nothing but good from her whom, he bitterly feels, he has
cruelly wronged. <span class="sidenote">(2) <em>Tragedy
of Cordelia
and Kent.</em></span>But the punishment of the wrong-doer is
only one element in the consequences of wrong; the innocent
also are involved, and we get a second tragedy in the
sufferings of the faithful Kent and the loving Cordelia, who,
through Kent as her representative, watches over her father's
safety, until at the end she appears in person to follow up her
devotion to the death. When, however, the incidents making
up the sufferings of Lear, of Kent, and of Cordelia are taken
out of the main plot, there is still a considerable section left&mdash;
<span class="sidenote">(3) <em>Tragedy
of Goneril
and Regan.</em></span>that
which is occupied with the mutual intrigues of Goneril
and Regan, intrigues ending in their common ruin. This
constitutes a third tragedy which, it will be seen, is as necessary
to the solution of our problem as the other two. To
place power in the hands of the bad is an injury not only to
others, but also to the bad themselves, as giving fuel to the
fire of their wickedness: so in the tragedy of Goneril and
Regan we see evil passions placed in improper authority
using this authority to work out their own destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>An underplot
on the
same basis
as the main
plot.</em></div>

<p>To this main plot is added an underplot equally elaborate.
As in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, the stories borrowed from two
distinct sources are worked into a common design: and the
interweaving in the case of the present play is perhaps
Shakespeare's greatest triumph of constructive skill. The
two stories are made to rest upon the same fundamental idea&mdash;<span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> i, fin.</span>that
of undutifulness to old age: what Lear's daughters
actually do is that which is insinuated by Edmund as his
false charge against his brother.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 76, &amp;c.</div>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
and fathers declining, the father should be as ward to the son, and the
son manage his revenue.</p></div>

<p>So obvious is this fundamental connection between the main
and the underplot, that our attention is called to it by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>personage in the play itself:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> vi. 117.</span>'he childed as I father'd,' is
Edgar's pithy summary of it when he is brought into contact
with Lear. <span class="sidenote"><em>The main
and underplot
parallel
and contrasted
throughout.</em></span>But in this double tragedy, drawn from the
two families of Lear and of Gloucester, the chief bond
between its two sides consists in the sharp contrast which
extends to every detail of the two stories. In the main plot
we have a daughter, who has received nothing but harm from
her father, who has unjustly had her position torn from her
and given to undeserving sisters: nevertheless she sacrifices
herself to save the father who did the injury from the sisters
who profited by it. In the underplot we have a son, who has
received nothing but good from his father, who has, contrary
to justice, been advanced by him to the position of an elder
brother whom he has slandered: nevertheless, he is seeking
the destruction of the father who did him the unjust kindness,
when he falls by the hand of the brother who was wronged
by it. Thus as the main and underplot go on working side
by side, they are at every turn by their antithesis throwing up
one another's effect; the contrast is like the reversing of the
original subject in a musical fugue. <span class="sidenote"><em>The underplot
an
Intrigue
Action:</em></span>Again, as the main
plot consisted in the initiation of a problem and its solution,
so the underplot consists in the development of an intrigue
and its consequences. The tragedy of the Gloucester family
will, if stated from the point of view of the father, correspond
in its parts with the tragedy in the family of Lear.
It must be remembered, however, that the position of the
father is different in the two cases; Gloucester is not, as Lear,
the agent of the crime, but only a deceived instrument in the
hands of the villain Edmund, who is the real agent; if the
proper allowance be made for this difference, <span class="sidenote"><em>involving
a triple
tragedy
parallel
with that
of the main
plot.</em></span>it will be seen
that the three tragedies which make up the consequences of
Lear's error have their analogies in the three tragedies which
flow from the intrigue of Edmund. <span class="sidenote">(1) <em>Tragedy
of Gloucester.</em></span>First, we have the
nemesis on Gloucester, and this, in analogy with the nemesis
on Lear, consists in receiving nothing but evil from the son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>he has so hastily advanced, and nothing but good from the
other son whom, he comes gradually to feel, he has unintentionally
wronged. <span class="sidenote">(2) <em>Tragedy
of Edgar.</em></span>In the next place we have the sufferings
of the innocent Edgar. <span class="sidenote">(3) <em>Tragedy
of Edmund.</em></span>Then, as we before saw a third
tragedy in the way in which the power conferred upon
Goneril and Regan is used to work out their destruction, so
in the underplot we find that the position which Edmund has
gained involves him in intrigues, which by the development of
the play are made to result in a nemesis upon his original
intrigue. And it is a nemesis of exquisite exactness: for he
meets his death in the very moment of his success, at the
hands of the brother he has maligned and robbed, while
the father he has deceived and sought to destroy is the
means by which the avenger has been brought to the scene.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Complexity
of plot not
inconsistent
with
simplicity
of movement.</em></div>

<p>We have gone far enough into the construction of the plot
to perceive its complexity and the principal elements into
which that complexity can be analysed. Two separate systems,
each consisting of an initial action and three resulting
tragedies, eight actions in all, are woven together by common
personages and incidents, by parallelism of spirit, and by
movement to a common climax; not to speak of lesser
Link Actions which assist in drawing the different stories
closer together. As with plot generally, these separate elements
are fully manifest only to the eye of analysis; in
following the course of the drama itself, they make themselves
felt only in a continued sense of involution and harmonious
symmetry. It is with passion, not with plot, that
the present study is concerned; and the train of passion
which the common movement of these various actions calls
out in the sympathy of the reader is as simple as the plot
itself is intricate. In the case both of the main plot and
the underplot the emotional effect rises in intensity; moreover
at this central height of intensity the two merge in a
common Climax. The construction of the play resembles, if
such a comparison may be allowed, the patent gas-apparatus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>which secures a high illuminating power by the simple
device of several ordinary burners inclined to one another at
such an angle that the apexes of their flames meet in a point.
<span class="sidenote">from <strong>ii.</strong> iv.
290 to <strong>iii.</strong>
vi. with the
interruption
of <strong>iii.</strong>
iii, <strong>iii.</strong> v.</span>So the present play contains a Centrepiece of some three
scenes, marked off (at least at the commencement) decisively,
in which the main and underplot unite in a common Climax,
with special devices to increase its effect;
<span class="sidenote"><em>The different
trains
of passion
focussed in
a central
Climax.</em></span>the diverse interests
to which our sympathy was called out at the commencement,
and which analysis can keep distinct to the end, are <em>focussed</em>,
so far as passion is concerned, in this Centrepiece, in which
human emotion is carried to the highest pitch of tragic
agitation that the world of art has yet exhibited.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The passions
of the
main plot
gather to a
common
Climax in
the madness
of Lear.</em></div>

<p>The emotional effect of the main plot rises to a climax in
the madness of Lear. This, as the highest form of human
agitation, is obviously a climax to the story of Lear himself.
It is equally a climax to the story of Kent and Cordelia, who
suffer solely through their devoted watching over Lear, and
to whom the bitterest point in their sufferings is that they feel
over again all that their fallen master has to endure. Finally,
in the madness of Lear the third of the three tragedies, the
Goneril and Regan action, appears throughout in the background
as the cause of all that is happening. If we keep our
eye upon this madness of Lear the movement of the play
assumes the form we have so often had to notice&mdash;the
regular arch. The first half of the arch, or rise in emotional
strain, we get in symptoms of mental disturbance preparing
us for actual madness which is to come. It is important to
note the difference between passion and madness: passion is
a disease of the mind, madness is a disease extending to the
mysterious linking of mind and body. At the commencement
Lear is dominated by the passion of imperiousness, an
imperiousness born of his absolute power as king and father;
he has never learned from discipline restraint of his passion,
but has been accustomed to fling himself upon obstacles and
see them give way before him. Now the tragical situation is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>prepared for him of meeting with obstacles which will not
give way, but from which his passion rebounds upon himself
with a physical shock. As thus opposition follows opposition,
we see <em>waves</em> of physical, that is of hysterical, passion, sweeping
over Lear, until, as it were, a tenth wave lands him in the
full disease of madness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv.</div>

<p>The first case occurs in his interview with Goneril after that
which is the first check he has received in his new life, the
insolence shown to his retinue. Goneril enters his presence
with a frown. The wont had been that Lear frowned and all
cowered before him: and now he waits for his daughter to
remember herself with a rising passion ill concealed under
the forced calmness with which he enquires, 'Are you our
daughter?' 'Doth any here know me?' But Goneril, on
the contrary, calmly assumes the position of reprover, and
details her unfounded charges of insolence against her father's
sober followers, until at last he hears himself desired</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">By her, that else will take the thing she begs,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>to disquantity his train. Then Lear breaks out:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">Darkness and devils!</div>
<div class="i0">Saddle my horses; call my train together.</div>
<div class="i0">Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee:</div>
<div class="i0">Yet have I left a daughter.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In a moment the thought of Cordelia's 'most small fault' and
how it had been visited upon her occurs to condense into a
single pang the whole sense of his folly; and here it is that
the first of these waves of physical passion comes over Lear,
its physical character marked by the physical action which
accompanies it:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 292.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">O Lear, Lear, Lear!</div>
<div class="i0">Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in, [<em>Striking his head.</em></div>
<div class="i0">And thy dear judgement out.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It lasts but for a moment: but it is a wave, and it will
return.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> v.</span>Accordingly in the next scene we see Lear on his
journey from one daughter to the other. He is brooding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>over the scene he is leaving behind, and he cannot disguise a
shade of anxiety, in his awakened judgment, that some such
scene may be reserved for him in the goal to which he is
journeying. He is half listening, moreover, to the Fool, who
harps on the same thought, that the King is suffering what he
might have expected, that the other daughter will be like the
first:&mdash;until there comes another of these sudden outbursts of
passion, in which Lear for a moment half foresees the end to
which he is being carried.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> v. 49.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!</div>
<div class="i0">Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Imperiousness is especially attached to outward signs of
reverence:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 4.</span>it is reserved for Lear when he arrives at Regan's
palace to find the messenger he has sent on to announce him
suffering the indignity of the stocks. At first he will not believe
that this has been done by order of his daughter and son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">Do make their children blind,</div>

him a third and more violent wave of hysterical agitation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 89.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>

He has mastered the passion by a strong effort: but it is a
wave, and it will return. He has mastered himself in order
to confront the culprits face to face: his altered position is
brought home to him when they refuse to receive him. And
the refusal is made the worse by the well-meant attempt of
Gloucester to palliate it, in which he unfortunately speaks of
the 'fiery quality' of the duke.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Lear.</em> Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!</div>
<div class="i3">Fiery? what quality?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nothing is harder than to endure what one is in the habit of
inflicting on others; it was Lear's own 'fiery quality' by
which he had been accustomed to scorch all opposition out
of his way; now he has to hear another man's 'fiery quality'
quoted to him. But this outburst is only momentary; the
very extremity of the case seems to calm Lear, and he begins
himself to frame excuses for the duke, how sickness and
infirmity neglect the 'office' to which health is bound&mdash;until
his eye lights again upon his messenger sitting in the stocks,
and the recollection of this deliberate affront brings back
again the wave of passion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">122.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lear had a strange confidence in his daughter Regan. As
we see the two women in the play, Regan appears the more
cold-blooded; nothing in Goneril is more cruel than
Regan's</p>

<div class="sidenote">204.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote">253.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And in good time you gave it.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But there was something in Regan's personal appearance
that belied her real character; her father says to her in this
scene:</p>

<div class="sidenote">173.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Her eyes are fierce, but thine</div>
<div class="i0">Do comfort and not burn.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>

Judas betrayed with a kiss, and Regan persecutes her father
in tears. But Regan has scarcely entered her father's presence
when the trumpet announces the arrival of Goneril, and
<span class="sidenote">185.</span>Lear
has to see the Regan
<span class="sidenote">197.</span>in whom he is trusting take Goneril's
hand before his eyes in token that she is making common
cause with her. When following this the words 'indiscretion,'
'dotage,' reach his ear there is a momentary swelling of the
physical passion within:</p>

<div class="sidenote">200.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i5">O sides, you are too tough;</div>
<div class="i0">Will you yet hold?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He has mastered it for the last time: for now his whole
world seems to be closing in around him; he has committed
his all to the two daughters standing before him,
<span class="sidenote">from 233.</span>and they
unite to beat him down, from fifty knights to twenty-five,
from twenty-five to ten, to five, until the soft-eyed Regan
asks, 'What need one?' A sense of crushing oppression
stifles his anger, and Lear begins to answer with the same
calmness with which the question had been asked:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O, reason not the need: our basest beggars</div>
<div class="i0">Are in the poorest thing superfluous:</div>
<div class="i0">Allow not nature more than nature needs,</div>
<div class="i0">Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;</div>
<div class="i0">If only to go warm were gorgeous,</div>
<div class="i0">Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,</div>
<div class="i0">Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He breaks off at finding himself actually pleading: and the
blinding tears come as he recognises that the kingly passion
in which he had found support at every cross has now
deserted him in his extremity. He appeals to heaven against
the injustice.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!</div>
<div class="i0">You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,</div>

<div class="i0">And let not women's weapons, water-drops,</div>

<p>The prayer is answered; the passion returns in full flood,

has threatened from a distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 290.</div>
<div class="sidenote">
<em>The storm
marks off
the Centrepiece
of the
play.</em></div>

<p>As Lear with these words rushes out into the night, we
hear the first sound of the storm&mdash;the storm which here, as
in <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, will be recognised as the dramatic background
to the tempest of human emotions; it is the signal
that we have now entered upon the mysterious Centrepiece
of the play, in which the gathering passions of the whole
drama are to be allowed to vent themselves without check or
bound. And it is no ordinary storm: it is a night of bleak
winds sorely ruffling, of cataracts and hurricanoes, of curled
waters swelling above the main, of thought-executing fires
and oak-cleaving thunderbolts; a night</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 12,
&amp;c.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">The lion and the belly-pinched wolf</div>
<div class="i0">Keep their fur dry.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And all of it is needed to harmonise with the whirlwind of
human passions which finds relief only in outscorning its fury.
The purpose of the storm is not confined to this of marking
the emotional climax: it is one of the agencies which assist
in carrying it to its height. Experts in mental disease have
noted amongst the causes which convert mere mental excitement
into actual madness two leading ones, external physical
shocks and imitation. Shakespeare has made use of both in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>the central scenes of this play.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 3:
<strong>iii.</strong> ii. &amp;c.</span>For the first, Lear is exposed
without shelter to the pelting of the pitiless storm, and he
waxes wilder with its wildness.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv, from
39.</span>Again when all this is at its
height he is suddenly brought into contact with a half-naked
Tom o'Bedlam. This gives the final shock. So far he had
not gone beyond ungovernable rage; he had not lost self-consciousness,
and could say, 'My wits begin to turn';
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 66.</span>but the sight of Edgar completely unhinges his mind, and
hallucinations set in; a moment after he has seen him the
spirit of imitation begins to work, and Lear commences to
strip off his clothes. Thus perfect is the regular arch of
effect which is connected with Lear's madness. We have its
gradual rise in the waves of hysterical passion which ebbed
after they had flowed, until, at the point separating the
Centrepiece from the rest of the play, Lear's 'O fool I <em>shall</em>
go mad' seems to mark a change from which he never goes
back. Through these central scenes exposure to the storm is
fanning his passion more and more irretrievably into madness;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 39.</span>at the exact centre of all, imitation of Edgar comes to
make the insanity acute.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Decline

there is no longer sharp suffering,

<p>But who is this madman with whom Lear meets at the
turning-point of the play? It is Edgar, the victim of the
underplot, whose life has been sought by his brother and
father until he can find no way of saving himself but the
disguise of feigned madness. This feigned madness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>Edgar, as it appears in the central scenes, serves as emotional
climax to the underplot, just as the madness of Lear is the
emotional climax of the main plot. Edgar's madness is
obviously the climax to the tragedy of his own sufferings,
but it is also a central point to the movement of the other
two tragedies which with that of Edgar make up the underplot.
One of these is the nemesis upon Gloucester, and this,
we have seen, is double, that he receives good from the son
he has wronged and evil from the son he has favoured.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 170.</span>The
turning-point of such a nemesis is reached in the Hovel
Scene, where Gloucester says:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">I'll tell thee, friend,</div>
<div class="i0">I am almost mad myself: I had a son,</div>
<div class="i0">Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,</div>
<div class="i0">But lately, very late: I loved him, friend:</div>
<div class="i0">No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,</div>
<div class="i0">This grief hath crazed my wits!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He says this in the presence of the very Edgar, disguised
under the form of the wretched idiot he hardly marks.
Edgar now learns how his father has been deceived;
<span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>iii.</strong> iii. 15.</span>in his
heart he is re-united to him, and from this point of re-union
springs the devotion he lavishes upon his father in the
affliction that presently falls upon him.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 22;
<strong>iii.</strong> vii.</span>On the other hand,
that which brings Gloucester to this Hovel Scene, the attempt
to save the King, is betrayed by Edmund, who becomes
thereby the cause of the vengeance which puts out his
father's eyes. Thus from this meeting of the mad Edgar
with the mad Lear there springs at once the final stroke in
the misery Gloucester suffers from the son he has favoured,
and the beginning of the forgiving love he is to experience
from the son he has wronged: that meeting then is certainly
the central climax to the double nemesis which makes up the
Gloucester action. The remaining tragedy of the underplot
embraces the series of incidents by the combination of
which the success of Edmund's intrigue becomes gradually
converted into the nemesis which punishes it. Now the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>squalid wretchedness of a Bedlamite, together with the
painful strain of supporting the assumed character amidst
the conflicting emotions which the unexpected meeting of
the Hovel Scene has aroused, represent the highest point to
which the misery resulting from the intrigue can rise.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i, &amp;c.</span>At the same time the use Edgar makes of this madness after
hearing Gloucester's confession is to fasten himself in attendance
upon his afflicted father, and proves in the sequel the
means by which he is brought to be the instrument of the
vengeance that overtakes Edmund. The central climax of
a tragedy like this of intrigue and nemesis cannot be more
clearly marked than in the incident in which are combined
the summit of the injury and the foundation of the retribution.
Thus all three tragedies which together make up
the resultant of the intrigue constituting the underplot reach
their climax of agitation in the scene in which Lear and
Edgar meet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The
Centrepiece a
duet, or
by the
addition of
the Fool,
a trio of
madness.</em></div>

<p>It appears, then, that the Centrepiece of the play is occupied
with the contact of two madnesses, the madness of Lear and
the madness of Edgar; that of Lear gathering up into a
climax trains of passion from all the three tragedies of the
main plot, and that of Edgar holding a similar position to the
three tragedies of the underplot. Further, these madnesses
do not merely go on side by side; as they meet they
mutually affect one another, and throw up each other's
intensity. By the mere sight of the Bedlamite, Lear, already
tottering upon the verge of insanity, is driven really and
incurably mad; while in the case of Edgar, the meeting with
Lear, and through Lear with Gloucester, converts the burden
of feigning idiocy from a cruel stroke of unjust fate into a
hardship voluntarily undergone for the sake of ministering to
a father now forgiven and pitied. And so far as the general
effect of the play is concerned this central Climax presents a
terrible <em>duet of madness</em>, the wild ravings and mutual interworkings
of two distinct strains of insanity, each answering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>and outbidding the other. The distinctness is the greater as
the two are different in kind. In Lear we have the madness
of passion, exaggeration of ordinary emotions; Edgar's is
the madness of idiocy, as idiocy was in early ages when the
cruel neglect of society added physical hardship to mental
affliction. In Edgar's frenzy we trace rapid irrelevance
with gleams of unexpected relevance, just sufficient to partly
answer a question and go off again into wandering; a sense
of ill-treatment and of being an outcast; remorse and
thoughts as to close connection of sin and retribution; visions
of fiends as in bodily presence; cold, hunger: these alternating
with mere gibberish, and all perhaps within the
compass of a few lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 51.</div>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led
through fire and through flame, and through ford and whirlipool, o'er
bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made him proud of heart, to
ride on a bay trotting-horse over four-inched bridges, to course his own
shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,&mdash;O, do de,
do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking!
Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could
I have him now,&mdash;and there,&mdash;and there again, and there.</p></div>

<p>But this is not all. When examined more closely this
Centrepiece exhibits not a duet but a <em>trio of madness</em>; with
the other two there mingles a third form of what may be
called madness, the professional madness of the court fool.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Institution
of the court
fool.</em></span>This court fool or jester is an institution of considerable
interest. It seems to rest upon three mediæval and ancient
notions. The first is the barbarism of enjoying personal
defects, illustrated in the large number of Roman names
derived from bodily infirmities, Varus the bandy-legged, Balbus
the stammerer, and the like; this led our ancestors to
find fun in the incoherence of natural idiocy, and finally
made the imitation of it a profession. A second notion
underlying the institution of a jester is the connection to the
ancient mind between madness and inspiration; the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>Greek word <em>entheos</em> stands for both, and to this day the idiot
of a Scotch village is believed in some way to see further
than sane folk. A third idea to be kept in mind is the mediæval
conception of wit. With us wit is weighed by its
intrinsic worth; the old idea, appearing repeatedly in Shakespeare's
scenes, was that wit was a mental game, a sort of
battledore and shuttlecock, in which the jokes themselves
might be indifferent since the point of the game lay in keeping
it up as smartly and as long as possible. The fool,
whose title and motley dress suggested the absence of
ordinary sense or propriety, combines in his office all three
notions: from the last he was bound to keep up the fire of
badinage, even though it were with witless nonsense; from
the second he was expected at times to give utterance to
deep truths; and in virtue of the first he had license to make
hard hits under protection of the 'folly' which all were
supposed to enjoy.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">He that hath a fool doth very wisely hit,</div>
<div class="i0">Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</div>
<div class="i0">Not to seem senseless of the bob.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The institution
adapted to
modern
times in
Punch.</em></div>

<p>The institution, if it has died out as a personal office attached
to kings or nobles, has perhaps been preserved by the nation
as a whole in a form analogous to other modern institutions:
the all-embracing newspaper has absorbed this element of
life, and Mr. Punch is the national jester. His figure and face
are an improvement on the old motley habit; his fixed number
of pages have to be filled, if not always with wit, yet with
passable padding: no one dare other than enjoy the compliment
of his notice, under penalty of showing that 'the cap
has fitted'; and certainly Mr. Punch finds ways of conveying
to statesmen criticisms to which the proprieties of parliament
would be impervious. The institution of the court fool is
eagerly utilised by Shakespeare, and is the source of some of
his finest effects: he treats it as a sort of chronic Comedy, the
function of which may be described as that of translating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>deep truths of human nature into the language of
laughter.</p>

<p>In applying, then, this general view of the court fool to the
present case we must avoid two opposite errors. We must
not pass over all his utterances as unmeaning folly, nor, on
the other hand, must we insist upon seeing a meaning in
everything that he says: what truth he speaks must be expected
to make its appearance amidst a cloud of nonsense.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The function
of the
Fool in
Lear is to
keep before
us the
original
problem:</em></span>Making this proviso we may lay down that the function of
the Fool in <em>King Lear</em> is to keep vividly before the minds of
the audience (as well as of his master) the idea at the root of
the main plot&mdash;that unstable moral equilibrium, that unnatural
distribution of power which Lear has set up, and of
which the whole tragedy is the rebound.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv.</span>In the first scene
in which he appears before us he is, amid all his nonsense,
harping upon the idea that Lear has committed the folly of
trusting to the gratitude of the ungrateful, and is reaping the
inevitable consequences. As he enters he hands his coxcomb,
the symbol of folly, to the King, and to Kent for taking
the King's part. His first jingling song,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Have more than thou showest,</div>
<div class="i0">Speak less than thou knowest,</div>
<div class="i0">Lend less than thou owest, &amp;c.,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>is an expansion of the maxim, Trust nobody. And however
irrelevant he becomes, he can in a moment get back to this
root idea. They tell him his song is nothing:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Fool.</em> Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you gave me</div>
<div class="i0">nothing for 't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Fool</em> [<em>to Kent</em>]. Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of his land comes
to: he will not believe a fool.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 92.</div>

<p>'Nothing will come of nothing' had been the words Lear
had used to Cordelia; now he is bidden to see how they
have become the exact description of his own fortune. No
wonder Lear exclaims, 'A bitter fool!'</p>

back to the main thought.</p>

<p>In the scene which follows, the Fool is performing a variation
on the same theme: the sudden removal from one sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>to the other is no real escape from the original foolish
situation.</p>

<p>To say that Lear is in no danger of suffering from brains in

goes on to insist that the other daughter will treat her father

His laying down that the reason why the nose is in the
middle of the face is to keep the eyes on either side of the
nose, and that the reason why the seven stars are no more
than seven is 'a pretty reason&mdash;because they are not eight,'
suggests (if it be not pressing it too far) that we must not
look for depth where there is only shallowness&mdash;the mistake
Lear has made in trusting to the gratitude of his daughters.
And the general thought of Lear's original folly he brings
out, true to the fool's office, from the most unlikely beginnings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 1-128.</div>

<p>All through the scene in front of the stocks the Fool is harping
on the folly of expecting gratitude from such as Goneril
and Regan. It is fathers who bear bags that see their children
kind; the wise man lets go his hold on a great wheel running
down hill, but lets himself be drawn after by the great wheel
that goes up the hill; he himself, the Fool hints, is a fool for
staying with Lear; to cry out at Goneril and Regan's behaviour
is as unreasonable as for the cook to be impatient
with the eels for wriggling; to have trusted the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>daughters with power at all was like the folly of the man that,
'in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.'</p>

<p>The one idea, then, stationary amidst all the Fool's gyrations
of folly is the idea of Lear's original sin of passion, from the
consequences of which he can never escape; <span class="sidenote"><em>but in an
emotional
form as
adapted to
the agitation
of the
Centrepiece.</em></span>only the idea is
put, not rationally, but translated into an emotional form
which makes it fit to mingle with the agitation of the central
scenes. The emotional form consists partly in the irrelevance
amid which the idea is brought out, producing continual
shocks of surprise. But more than this an emotional form is
given to the utterances of the Fool by his very position with
reference to Lear. <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 16;
<strong>iii.</strong> ii. 10,
25, 68; <strong>iii.</strong>
iv. 80, 150.</span>There is a pathos that mingles with his
humour, where the Fool, a tender and delicate youth, is found
the only attendant who clings to Lear amid the rigour of the
storm, labouring with visibly decreasing vigour to out-jest
his master's heart-struck injuries, and to keep up holiday
abandon amidst surrounding realities.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 107;
<strong>iii.</strong> ii. 68,
72, &amp;c.</span>Throughout he is
Lear's best friend, and epithets of endearment are continually
passing between them: he has been Cordelia's friend (as
Touchstone was the friend of Rosalind),
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 79.</span>and pined for Cordelia
after her banishment. Nevertheless he is the only one
who can deliver hard thrusts at Lear, and bring home to him,
under protection of his double relation to wisdom and folly,
Lear's original error and sin. So faithful and so severe, the
Fool becomes an outward conscience to his master: he keeps
before Lear the unnatural act from which the whole tragedy
springs, but he converts the thought of it into the emotion of
self-reproach.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Summary.</em></div>

<p>Our total result then is this. The intricate drama of <em>King
Lear</em> has a general movement which centres the passion of
the play in a single Climax. Throughout a Centrepiece of a
few scenes, against a background of storm and tempest is
thrown up a tempest of human passion&mdash;a madness trio, or
mutual play of three sorts of madness, the real madness of
passion in Lear, the feigned madness of idiocy in Edgar, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>the professional madness of the court fool. When the
elements of this madness trio are analysed, the first is found
to gather up into itself the passion of the three tragedies
which form the main plot; the second is a similar climax to
the passion of the three tragedies which make up the underplot;
the third is an expression, in the form of passion, of the
original problem out of which the whole action has sprung.
Thus intricacy of plot has been found not inconsistent with
simplicity of movement, and from the various parts of the
drama the complex trains of passion have been brought to a
focus in the centre.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Topics of Dramatic Criticism.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Purpose:
to survey
Dramatic
Criticism
as an inductive
science.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">IN the Introduction to this book I pleaded that a regular
inductive science of literary criticism was a possibility.
In the preceding ten chapters I have endeavoured to exhibit
such a regular method at work on the dramatic analysis of
leading points in Shakespeare's plays. The design of the
whole work will not be complete without an attempt to
present our results in complete form, in fact to map out a
Science of Dramatic Art. I hope this may not seem too pretentious
an undertaking in the case of a science yet in its
infancy; while it may be useful at all events to the young
student to have suggested to him a methodical treatment with
which he may exercise himself on the literature he studies.
Moreover the reproach against literary criticism is, not that
there has not been plenty of inductive work done in this department,
but that the assertion of its inductive character has
been lacking; and I believe a critic does good service by
throwing his results into a formal shape, however imperfectly
he may be able to accomplish his task. It will be understood
that the survey of Dramatic Science is here attempted only
in the merest outline: it is a glimpse, not a view, of a new
science that is proposed. Not even a survey would be possible
within the limits of a few short chapters except by confining
the matter introduced to that previously laid before the
reader in a different form. The leading features of Dramatic
Art have already been explained in the application of them
to particular plays: they are now included in a single view,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>so arranged that their mutual connection may be seen to be
building up this singleness of view. Such a survey, like a
microscopic lens of low power, must sacrifice detail to secure
a wider field. Its compensating gain will consist in what it
can contribute to the orderly product of methodised enquiry
which is the essence of science, and the interest in which
becomes associated with the interest of curiosity when the
method has been applied in a region not usually acknowledging
its reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Definition
of Dramatic
Criticism:</em></div>

<p>The starting-point in the exposition of any science is
naturally its definition. But this first step is sufficient to
divide inductive criticism from the treatment of literature
mostly in vogue. I have already protested against the criticism
which starts with the assumption of some 'object' or
'fundamental purpose' in the Drama from which to deduce
binding canons. Such an all-embracing definition, if it is
possible at all, will come as the final, not the first, step of
investigation. <span class="sidenote"><em>as to its
field and its
method.</em></span>Inductive criticism, on the contrary, will seek
its point of departure from outside. On the one hand it will
consider the relation of the matter which it proposes to treat
to other matter which is the subject of scientific enquiry; on
the other hand it will fix the nature of the treatment it
proposes to apply by a reference to scientific method in
general. That is to say, its definition will be based upon
differentiation of matter and development in method.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Stages of development
in inductive
method.</em></div>

<p>To begin with the latter. There are three well-marked
stages in the development of sciences. The first consists in
the mere observation of the subject-matter. The second is
distinguished by arrangement of observations, by analysis and
classification. The third stage reaches systematisation&mdash;the
wider arrangement which satisfies our sense of explanation,
that curiosity as to causes which is the instinct specially
developed by scientific enquiry. Astronomy remained for
long ages in the first stage, while it was occupied with the
observation of the heavenly bodies and the naming of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>constellations. It would pass into the second stage with
division of labour and the study of solar, lunar, planetary, and
cometary phenomena separately. But by such discoveries as
that of the laws of motion, or of gravitation, the great mass
of astronomical knowledge was bound together in a system
which at the same time satisfied the sense of causation, and
astronomy was fully developed as an inductive science. Or
to take a more modern instance: comparative philology has
attained completeness in our own day. Philology was in its
first stage at the Renaissance, when 'learning' meant the
mere accumulation of detailed knowledge connected with the
Classical languages; Grimm's Law may illustrate the second
stage, a classification comprehensive but purely empiric; the
principle of phonetic decay with its allied recuperative processes
has struck a unity through the laws of philology which
stamps it as a full-grown science. <span class="sidenote"><em>Dramatic
Criticism
in the intermediate</em></span>Applying this to our
present subject, I do not pretend that Literary Criticism has
reached the third of these three stages: but materials are
ready for giving it a secure place in the second stage. In
time, no doubt, literary science must be able to explain the
modus operandi of literary production, and show how different
classes of writing come to produce their different effects.
But at present such explanation belongs mostly to the region
of speculation; and before the science of criticism is ripe
for this final stage much work has to be done in the way of
methodising observation as to literary matter and form.</p>

<p>Dramatic Criticism, then, is still in the stage of provisional
arrangement. <span class="sidenote"><em>or 'topical'
stage.</em></span>Its exact position is expressed by the technical
term 'topical.' Where accumulation of observations is great
enough to necessitate methodical arrangement, yet progress
is insufficient to suggest final bases of arrangement which
will crystallise the whole into a system, science takes refuge
in 'topics.' These have been aptly described as intellectual
pigeon-holes&mdash;convenient headings under which materials
may be digested, with strict adherence to method, yet only as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>a provisional arrangement until further progress shall bring
more stable organisation. This topical treatment may seem
an unambitious stage in scientific advance, the goal and
reward of which is insight into wide laws and far-reaching
systematisations. Still it is a stage directly in the line of sound
method: and the judicious choice of main and subordinate
topics is systematisation in embryo. The present enquiry
looks no further than this stage in its analysis of Dramatic
Art. It endeavours to find convenient headings under which
to set forth its observations of Shakespeare's plays. It also
seeks an arrangement of these topics that will at once cover
the field of the subject, and also carry on the face of it such
an economy of mutual connection as may make the topics,
what they ought to be, a natural bridge between the general
idea which the mind forms of Drama and the realisation of
this idea in the details of actual dramatic works.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Continuous
differentiation
of
scientific
subject-matter.</em></div>

<p>But the definition of our subject involves further that we
should measure out the exact field within which this method
is to be applied. Science, like every other product of the
human mind, marks its progress by continuous differentiation:
the perpetual subdivision of the field of enquiry, the
rise of separate and ever minuter departments as time goes
on. Originally all knowledge was one and undivided. The
name of Socrates is connected with a great revolution which
separated moral science from physics, the study of man from
the study of nature. With Aristotle and inductive method
the process became rapid: and under his guidance ethics, as
the science of conduct, became distinct from mental science;
and still further, political science, treating man in his relations
with the state, was distinguished from the more general
science of conduct. When thought awoke at the Renaissance
after the sleep of the Dark Ages, political science threw
off as a distinct branch political economy; and by our own
day particular branches of economy, finance, for example,
have practically become independent sciences. This characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>of science in general, the perpetual tendency to
separate more confined from more general lines of investigation,
will apply in an especial degree to literature, <span class="sidenote"><em>Dramatic
Criticism
branches off
on the one
side from
the wider
Literary
Criticism.</em></span>which
covers so wide an area of the mind and is the meeting-ground
of so many separate interests. Thus Shakespeare is
a poet, and his works afford a field for considering poetry in
general, both as a mode of thought and a mode of expression.
Again, no writer could go so deeply into human nature as
Shakespeare has done without betraying his philosophy and
moral system. Once more, Shakespeare must afford a
specimen of literary tendencies in general, and that particular
modification of them we call Elizabethan; besides that
the language which is the vehicle of this literature has an
interest of its own over and above that of the thought which
it conveys. All this and more belongs properly to 'Shakespeare-Criticism':
but from Literary Criticism as a whole a
branch is being gradually differentiated, Dramatic Criticism,
and its province is to deal with the question, how much of
the total effect of Shakespeare's works arises from the fact of
his ideas being conveyed to us in the form of dramas, and
not of lyric or epic poems, of essays or moral and philosophical
treatises. It is with this branch alone that the present
enquiry is concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>On the
other side
from the
allied art
of Stage-Representation.</em></div>

<p>But more than this goes to the definition of Dramatic
Criticism. Drama is not, like Epic, merely a branch of
literature: it is a compound art. The literary works which
in ordinary speech we call dramas, are in strictness only
potential dramas waiting for their realisation on the stage.
And this stage-representation is not a mere accessory of
literature, but is an independent art, having a field where
literature has no place, in dumb show, in pantomime, in
mimicry, and in the lost art of Greek 'dancing.'</p>

<p>The question arises then, what is to be the relation of Dramatic
Criticism to the companion art of Stage-Representation?
Aristotle, the father of Dramatic Criticism, made Stage-Representation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>one of the departments of the science; but we shall
be only following the law of differentiation if we separate the
two. This is especially appropriate in the case of the Shakespearean
Drama. The Puritan Revolution, which has played
such a part in its history, was in effect an attack rather on
the Theatre than on the Drama itself. No doubt when the
movement became violent the two were not discriminated,
and the Drama was made a 'vanity' as well as the Stage.
Still the one interest was never so thoroughly dropped by the
nation and was more readily taken up again than the other;
so that from the point of view of the Stage our continuity with
the Elizabethan age has been severed, from the point of view
of the literary Drama it has not. The Shakespearean Drama
has made a field for itself as a branch of literature quite
apart from the Stage; and, however we may regret the
severance and look forward to a completer appreciation of
Shakespeare, yet it can hardly be doubted that at the present
moment as earnest and comprehensive an interest in our
great dramatist is to be found in the study as in the
theatre.</p>

<p>Dramatic Criticism, then, is to be separated, on the one
side, from the wider Literary Criticism which must include a
review of language, ethics, philosophy, and general art; and,
on the other hand, from the companion art of Stage-Representation.
But here caution is required; for all these are so
closely and so organically connected with the Drama that
there cannot but exist a mutual reaction.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Topics
common to
Drama
and art in
general.</em></span>Thus we have
already had to treat of topics which belong to the Drama
only as a part of literature and art in general. In the first
chapter we had occasion to notice how even the raw material
out of which the Shakespearean Drama is constructed itself
forms another species in literature. When we proceeded to
watch the process of working up this Story into dramatic
form we were led on to what was common ground between
Drama and the other arts. In such process we saw illustrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>the 'hedging,' or double process which leaves monstrosity
to produce its full impression and yet provides by
special means against any natural reaction; the reduction
of improbabilities, by which difficulties in the subject-matter
are evaded or met; the utilisation of mechanical details to
assist more important effects; the multiplication and interweaving
of different interests by which each is made to assist
the rest. Such points of Mechanical Construction, together
with the general principles of balance and symmetry, are not
special to any one branch of art: in all alike the artist will
contrive not wholly to conceal his processes, but by occasional
glimpses will add to higher effects the satisfaction of
our sense of neat workmanship.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Drama and
its Representation
separate in
exposition,
not in idea.</em></div>

<p>Similarly, it may be convenient to make Literary Drama
and Stage-Representation separate branches of enquiry: it is
totally inadmissible and highly misleading to divorce the two
in idea. The literary play must be throughout read <em>relatively</em>
to its representation. In actual practice the separation of the
two has produced the greatest obstacles in the way of sound
appreciation. Amongst ordinary readers of Shakespeare
Character-Interest, which is largely independent of performance,
has swallowed up all other interests; and most of the
effects which depend upon the connection and relative force
of incidents, and on the compression of the details into a
given space, have been completely lost. Shakespeare is
popularly regarded as supreme in the painting of human
nature, but careless in the construction of Plot: and, worst
of all, Plot itself, which it has been the mission of the
English Drama to elevate into the position of the most
intellectual of all elements in literary effect, has become
degraded in conception to the level of a mere juggler's
mystery. It must then be laid down distinctly at the outset
of the present enquiry that the Drama is to be considered
throughout relatively to its acting. Much of dramatic effect
that is special to Stage-Representation will be here ignored:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>the whole mechanism of elocution, effects of light, colour and
costume, the greater portion of what constitutes <em>mise-en-scène</em>.
But in dealing with any play the fullest scope is assumed
for ideal acting. The interpretation of a character must
include what an actor can put into it; in dealing with
effects regard must be had to surroundings which a reader
might easily overlook, but which would be present to the eye
of a spectator; and no conception of the movement of a
drama will be adequate which has not appreciated the rapid
sequence of incidents that crowds the crisis of a life-time or
a national revolution into two or three hours of actual time.
The relation of Drama to its acting will be exactly similar to
that of music to its performance, the two being perfectly
separable in their exposition, but never disunited in idea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Fundamental
division
of
Dramatic
Criticism
into Human
Interest
and Action.</em></div>

<p>Dramatic Art, then, as thus defined, is to be the field of
our enquiry, and its method is to be the discovery and
arrangement of topics. For a fundamental basis of such
analysis we shall naturally look to the other arts. Now all
the arts agree in being the union of two elements, abstract
and concrete. Music takes sensuous sounds, and adds a
purely abstract element by disposing these sounds in harmonies
and melodies; architecture applies abstract design
to a concrete medium of stone and wood; painting gives
us objects of real life arranged in abstract groupings: in
dancing we have moving figures confined in artistic bonds of
rhythm; sculpture traces in still figures ideas of shape and
attitude. So Drama has its two elements of Human Interest
and Action: on the one hand life <em>presented in action</em>&mdash;so the
word 'Drama' may be translated; on the other hand the
<em>action</em> itself, that is, the concurrence of all that is presented
in an abstract unity of design. The two fundamental
divisions of dramatic interest, and consequently the two fundamental
divisions of Dramatic Criticism, will thus be
Human Interest and Action. But each of these has its
different sides, the distinction of which is essential before we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>can arrive at an arrangement of topics that will be of practical
value in the methodisation of criticism.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Twofold
division of
Human
Interest.</em></span>The interest of the
life presented is twofold. There is our interest in the
separate personages who enter into it, as so many varieties
of the <em>genus homo</em>: this is Interest of <em>Character</em>. There is
again our interest in the experience these personages are
made to undergo, their conduct and fate: technically, Interest
of <em>Passion</em>.</p>

<p class="center">
Human Interest <span class="combination">

<span class="above">Character.</span>
<span class="belowb">Passion.</span>
</span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Threefold
division of
Action.</em></div>

<p>It is the same with the other fundamental element of art, the
working together of all the details so as to leave an impression
of unity: while in practice the sense of this unity, say
in a piece of music or a play, is one of the simplest of
instincts, yet upon analysis it is seen to imply three separate
mental impressions. The mind, it implies, must be conscious
of a unity. It must also be conscious of a complexity of
details without which the unity could not be perceptible.
But the mere perception of unity and of complexity would
give no art-pleasure unless the unity were seen to be <em>developed</em>
out of the complexity, and this brings in a third idea of progress
and gradual <em>Movement</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Application

<p>Now if we apply the threefold idea involved in Action to the
twofold idea involved in Human Interest we shall get the
natural divisions of dramatic analysis. One element of
Human Interest was Character: looking at this in the threefold
aspect which is given to it when it is connected with
Action we shall have to notice the interest of single characters,
or <em>Character-Interpretation</em>, the more complex interest
of <em>Character-Contrast</em>, and in the third place <em>Character-Development</em>.
Applying a similar treatment to the other side of
Human Interest, Passion, we shall review single elements of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>Passion, that is to say, <em>Incidents and Effects</em>; the mixture of
various passions to express which the term <em>Passion-Tones</em>
will be used; and again <em>Passion-Movement</em>. But Action
has an interest of its own, considered in the abstract and as
separate from Human Interest. This is <em>Plot</em>; and it will lend
itself to the same triple treatment, falling into the natural
divisions of <em>Single Action</em>, <em>Complex Action</em>, and that development
of Plot which constitutes dramatic <em>Movement</em> in the
most important sense. At this point it is possible only to
name these leading topics of Dramatic Criticism: to explain
each, and to trace them further into their lesser ramifications
will be the work of the remaining three chapters.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Interest of Character.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Unity applied
to
Character:
Character
Interpretation.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">OF the main divisions of dramatic interest Character
stands first for consideration: and we are to view it
under the three aspects of unity, complexity, and movement.
The application of the idea unity to the idea character
suggests at once our interest in single personages. This
interest becomes more defined when we take into account
the medium through which the personages are presented to
us: characters in Drama are not brought out by abstract
discussion or description, but are presented to us concretely,
self-pourtrayed by their own actions without the assistance
of comments from the author.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the leading interest of character is <em>Interpretation</em>, the
mental process of turning from the concrete to the abstract: from the
most diverse details of conduct and impression Interpretation extracts a
unity of conception which we call a character. <span class="sidenote"><em>Interpretation of the
nature of an hypothesis.</em></span>Interpretation when scientifically handled must
be, we have seen, of the nature of an hypothesis, the value of which
depends upon the degree in which it explains whatever details have any
bearing upon the character. Such an hypothesis may be a simple idea: and
we have seen at length how the whole portraiture of Richard precipitates
into the notion of Ideal Villainy, ideal on the subjective side in an
artist who follows crime for its own sake, and on the objective side in
a success that works by fascination. But the student must beware of the
temptation to grasp at epigrammatic labels as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>sufficient solutions
of character; in the great majority of cases Interpretation can become
complete only by recognising and harmonising various and even
conflicting elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Canons of Interpretation.</em></div>

<p>Incidentally we have noticed some of the principles governing
careful Interpretation. <span class="sidenote"><em>It must be
Exhaustive.</em></span>One of these principles is that it
must take into consideration all that is presented of a personage.
It is unscientific on the face of it to say (as is
repeatedly said) that Shakespeare is 'inconsistent' in ascribing
deep musical sympathies to so thin a character as
Lorenzo. Such allegation of inconsistency means that the
process of Interpretation is unfinished; it can be paralleled
only by the astronomer who should complain of eclipses as
'inconsistent' with his view of the moon's movements. In
the particular case we found no difficulty in harmonising the
apparent conflict: the details of Lorenzo's portraiture fit
in well with the not uncommon type of nature that is so
deeply touched by art sensibilities as to have a languid interest
in life outside art. <span class="sidenote"><em>It must take
in indirect
evidence;</em></span>Again: Interpretation must look
for <em>indirect</em> evidence of character, such as the impression a
personage seems to have made on other personages in the
story, or the effect of action outside the field of view. It is
impatient induction to pronounce Bassanio unworthy of
Portia merely from comparison of the parts played by the
two in the drama itself. It happens from the nature of the
story that the incidents actually represented in the drama
are such as always display Bassanio in an exceptional and
dependent position; but we have an opportunity of getting
to the other side of our hero's character by observing the
attitude held to him by others in the play, an attitude
founded not on the incidents of the drama alone, but upon
the sum total of his life and behaviour in the Venetian
world. This gives a very different impression; and when we
take into consideration the force with which his personality
sways all who approach him, from the strong Antonio and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>the intellectual Lorenzo to giddy Gratiano and the rough
common sense of Launcelot, then the character comes out
in its proper scale. <span class="sidenote"><em>and the degree
to
which the
character is
displayed.</em></span>As a third principle, it is perhaps too
obvious to be worth formulating that Interpretation must
allow for the degree to which the character is displayed by
the action: that Brutus's frigid eloquence at the funeral of
Cæsar means not coldness of feeling but stoicism of public
demeanour. <span class="sidenote"><em>Interpretation
reacting
on
the details.</em></span>It is a less obvious principle that the very
details which are to be unified into a conception of character
may have a different complexion given to them when
they are looked at in the light of the whole. It has been
noticed how Richard seems to manifest in some scenes a
slovenliness of intrigue that might be a stumbling-block to
the general impression of his character. But when in our
view of him as a whole we see what a large part is played
by the invincibility that is stamped on his very demeanour,
it becomes clear how this slovenliness can be interpreted by
the analyst, and represented by the actor, not as a defect
of power, but as a trick of bearing which measures his
own sense of his irresistibility. Principles like these flow
naturally from the fundamental idea of character and its unity.
Their practical use however will be mainly that of tests for
suggested interpretations: to the actual reading of character
in Drama, as in real life, the safest guide is sympathetic
insight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Complexity applied to Character.</em></div>

<p>The second element underlying all dramatic effect was
complexity; when complexity is applied to Character we
get Character-Contrast.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Character-Foils.</em></span>In its lowest degree this appears in
the form of <em>Character-Foils</em>: by the side of some prominent
character is placed another of less force and interest but cast
in the same mould, or perhaps moulded by the influence of
its principal, just as by the side of a lofty mountain are
often to be seen smaller hills of the same formation. Thus
beside Portia is placed Nerissa, beside Bassanio Gratiano,
beside Shylock Tubal; Richard's villainy stands out by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>comparison with Buckingham, Hastings, Tyrrel, Catesby,
any one of whom would have given blackness enough to an
ordinary drama. It is quite possible that minute examination
may find differences between such companion figures:
but the general effect of the combination is that the lesser
serves as foil to throw up the scale on which the other is
framed. The more pronounced effects of Character-Contrast
depend upon differences of kind as distinguished from
differences of degree.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Character-Contrast.</em></span>In this form it is clear how <em>Character-Contrast</em>
is only an extension of Character-Interpretation:
it implies that some single conception explains, that
is, gives unity to, the actions of more than one person. A
whole chapter has been devoted to bringing out such contrast
in the case of Lord and Lady Macbeth: to accept
these as types of the practical and inner life, cast in such an
age and involved in such an undertaking,
furnishes a conception
sufficient to make clear and intelligible all that the
two say and do in the scenes of the drama. <span class="sidenote"><em>Duplication.</em></span>Character-Contrast
is especially common amongst the minor effects in
a Shakespearean drama. In the case of personages demanded
by the necessities of the story rather than introduced for
their own sake Shakespeare has a tendency to double the
number of such personages for the sake of getting effects of
contrast. We have two unsuccessful suitors in <em>The Merchant
of Venice</em> bringing out, the one the unconscious pride of
royal birth, the other the pride of intense self-consciousness;
two wicked daughters of Lear, Goneril with no shading in
her harshness, Regan who is in reality a degree more calculating
in her cruelty than her sister, but conceals it under a
charm of manner, 'eyes that comfort and not burn.'
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i.</span>Of the two princes in <em>Richard III</em> the one has a gravity
beyond his years, while York overflows with not ungraceful
pertness. Especially interesting are the two murderers in
that play. <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv, from
84.</span>The first is a dull, 'strong-framed' man, without
any better nature. The second has had culture, and been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>accustomed to reflect; his better nature has been vanquished
by love of greed, and now asserts itself to prevent his
sinning with equanimity.
<span class="sidenote">110.</span>It is the second murderer whose
conscience is set in activity by the word 'judgment'; and he
discourses on conscience, deeply,
<span class="sidenote">124-157.</span>yet not without humour, as
he recognises the power of the expected reward over the oft-vanquished
compunctions. <span class="sidenote">167.</span>He catches, as a thoughtful
man, the irony of the duke's cry for wine when they are
about to drown him in the butt of malmsey.
<span class="sidenote">165.</span>Again, instead
of hurrying to the deed while Clarence is waking he cannot
resist the temptation to argue with him, and so, as a man
open to argument,
<span class="sidenote">263.</span>he feels the force of Clarence's unexpected
suggestion:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i7">He that set you on</div>
<div class="i0">To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus he exhibits the weakness of all thinking men in a
moment of action, the capacity to see two sides of a
question; and, trying at the critical moment to alter his
course, <span class="sidenote">284.</span>he ends by losing the reward of crime without
escaping the guilt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Character-Grouping.</em></div>

<p>Character-Contrast is carried forward into <em>Character-Grouping</em>
when the field is still further enlarged, and a single
conception is found to give unity to more than two personages
of a drama. A chapter has been devoted to showing
how the same antithesis of outer and inner life which
made the conception of Macbeth and his wife intelligible
would serve, when adapted to the widely different world of
Roman political life, to explain the characters of the leading
conspirators in <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, of their victim and of his
avenger: while, over and above the satisfaction of Interpretation,
the Grouping of these four figures, so colossal and so
impressive, round a single idea is an interest in itself.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Dramatic Colouring.</em></span>
The effect is carried a stage further still when some single phase
of human interest tends, in a greater or less degree, to give
a common feature to all the personages of a play; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>whole dramatic field is <em>coloured</em> by some idea, though of
course the interpretative significance of such an idea is
weakened in proportion to the area over which it is distributed.
The five plays to which our attention is confined
do not afford the best examples of Dramatic Colouring. It
is a point, however, of common remark how the play of
<em>Macbeth</em> is coloured by the superstition and violence of the
Dark Ages. The world of this drama seems given over to
powers of darkness who can read, if not mould, destiny;
witchcraft appears as an instrument of crime and ghostly
agency of punishment. We have rebellion without any
suggestion of cause to ennoble it, terminated by executions
without the pomp of justice; we have a long reign of terror
in which massacre is a measure of daily administration and
murder is a profession. With all this there is a total absence
of relief in any picture of settled life: there is no
rallying-point for order and purity. The very agent of
retribution gets the impulse to his task in a reaction from a
shock of bereavement that has come down upon him as
a natural punishment for an act of indecisive folly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">compare <strong>iv.</strong> iii. 26;
<strong>iv.</strong> ii. 1-22.</div>

<p>There are, then, three different effects that arise when
complexity enters into Character-Interest. The complexity
is one never separable from the unity which binds it together:
in the first effect the diversity is stronger than the
unity, and the whole manifests itself as Character-Contrast;
in Character-Grouping the contrast of the separate figures is
an equal element with the unity which binds them all into a
group; in the third case the diversity is lost in the unity,
and a uniformity of colouring is seized by the dramatic
sense as an effect apart from the individual varieties without
which such colouring would not be remarkable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Movement applied to Character: Character-Development.</em></div>

<p>When to Character-Interpretation, the formation of a
single conception out of a multitude of concrete details, the
further idea of growth and progress is added, we get the
third variety of Character-Interest&mdash;<em>Character-Development</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>In the preceding chapters this has received only negative
notice, its absence being a salient feature in the portraiture
of Richard. For a positive illustration no better example
could be desired than the character of Macbeth. Three
features, we have seen, stand out clear in the general conception
of Macbeth. There is his eminently practical nature,
which is the key to the whole. And the absence in him of
the inner life adds two special features: one is his helplessness
under suspense, the other is the activity of his imagination
with its susceptibility to supernatural terrors. Now, if
we fix our attention on these three points they become three
threads of development as we trace Macbeth through the
stages of his career. His practical power developes as
capacity for crime. Macbeth undertook his first crime only
after a protracted and terrible struggle; the murder of the
grooms was a crime of impulse; the murder of Banquo
appears a thing of contrivance, in which Macbeth is a
deliberate planner directing the agency of others,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 40,
&amp;c.</span>while his
dark hints to his wife suggest the beginning of a relish for
such deeds. This capacity for crime continues to grow,
until slaughter becomes an end in itself:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 4.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i7">Each new morn</div>
<div class="i0">New widows howl, new orphans cry:</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and then a mania:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> ii. 13.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him</div>
<div class="i0">Do call it valiant fury.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We see a parallel development in Macbeth's impatience of
suspense. Just after his first temptation he is able to brace
himself to suspense for an indefinite period:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 143.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,</div>
<div class="i0">Without my stir.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> vii.</div>

<p>On the eve of his great crime the suspense of the few hours
that must intervene before the banquet can be despatched
and Duncan can retire becomes intolerable to Macbeth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>he is for abandoning the treason. In the next stage it is
the suspense of a single moment that impels him to stab the
grooms. From this point suspense no longer comes by fits
and starts, but is a settled disease: <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 13,
36, &amp;c.</span>his mind is as scorpions;
it is tortured in restless ecstasy. Suspense has undermined
his judgment and brought on him the gambler's fever&mdash;the
haunting thought that just one more venture will make him
safe; in spite of the opposition of his reason&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 45.</span>which his
unwillingness to confide the murder of Banquo to his wife
betrays&mdash;he is carried on to work the additional crime which
unmasks the rest. And finally suspense intensifies to a panic,
and he himself feels that his deeds&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 140.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">must be acted ere they may be scann'd.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The third feature in Macbeth is the quickening of his sensitiveness
to the supernatural side by side with the deadening
of his conscience. Imagination becomes, as it were, a pictorial
conscience for one to whom its more rational channels
have been closed: the man who 'would jump the world to
come' accepts implicitly every word that falls from a witch.
Now this imagination is at first a restraining force in Macbeth:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 134.</span>the thought whose image unfixes his hair leads him to
abandon the treason. When later he has, under pressure,
delivered himself again to the temptation, there are still signs
that imagination is a force on the other side that has to be
overcome:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 50.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">Stars, hide your fires;</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Interest of Passion.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Passion.</span></div>

<p class="dropcap">HUMAN Interest includes not only varieties of human
nature, or Character, but also items of human experience,
or Passion. Passion is the second great topic of
Dramatic Criticism. It is concerned with the life that is lived
through the scenes of the story, as distinguished from the
personages who live it; not treating this with the abstract
treatment that belongs to Plot, but reviewing it in the light
of its human interest; it embraces conduct still alive with the
motives which have actuated it&mdash;fate in the process of forging.
The word 'passion' signifies primarily what is suffered of
good or bad; secondarily the emotions generated by suffering,
whether in the sufferer or in bystanders. Its use as a dramatic
term thus suggests how in Drama an experience can be
grasped by us through our emotional nature, through our
sympathy, our antagonism, and all the varieties of emotional
interest that lie between. To this Passion we have to apply
the threefold division of unity, complexity, and movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Unity applied
to
Passion.</em></div>

<p>When unity is applied to Passion we get a series of details
bound together into a singleness of impression as an Incident,
a Situation, or an Effect. The distinction of the three
rests largely on their different degrees of fragmentariness.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Incident.</em></span><em>Incidents</em> are groups of continuous details forming a complete
interest in themselves as ministering to our sense of
story. The suit of Shylock against Antonio in the course of
which fate swings right round; the murder of Clarence with
its long-drawn agony; Richard and Buckingham with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>Lord Mayor and Citizens exhibiting a picture of political
manipulation in the fifteenth century; the startling sight of a
Lady Anne wooed beside the bier of her murdered husband's
murdered father, by a murderer who rests his suit on
the murders themselves; Banquo's Ghost appearing at the
feast at which Banquo's presence had been so vehemently
called for; Lear's faithful Gloucester so brutally blinded
and so instantly avenged:&mdash;all these are complete stories
presented in a single view, and suggest how Shakespeare's
dramas are constructed out of materials which are themselves
dramas in miniature.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Situation.</em></span><em>Situation</em>, on the other hand,
a series of details cohere into a single impression without
losing the sense of incompleteness. The two central personages
of <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, around whom brightness
and gloom have been revolving in such contrast, at last
brought to face one another from the judgment-seat and the
dock; Lorenzo and Jessica wrapped in moonlight and
music, with the rest of the universe for the hour blotted out
into a background for their love; Margaret like an apparition
of the sleeping Nemesis of Lancaster flashed into the
midst of the Yorkist courtiers while they are bickering
through very wantonness of victory; Shylock pitted against
Tubal, Jew against Jew, the nature not too narrow to mix
affection with avarice, mocked from passion to passion by the
nature only wide enough to take in greed; Richard waking
on Bosworth morning, and miserably piecing together the
wreck of his invincible will which a sleeping vision has
shattered; Macbeth's moment of rapture in following the
airy dagger, while the very night holds its breath, to break out
again presently into voices of doom; the panic mist of
universal suspicion amidst which Malcolm blasts his own
character to feel after the fidelity of Macduff; Edgar from
his ambush of outcast idiocy watching the sad marvel of his
father's love restored to him:&mdash;all these brilliant Situations are
fragments of dramatic continuity in which the fragmentariness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>is a part of the interest. Just as the sense of sculpture
might seek to arrest and perpetuate a casual moment in the
evolutions of a dance, so in Dramatic Situation the mind is
conscious of isolating something from what precedes and
what follows so as to extract out of it an additional
impression; the morsel has its purpose in ministering to a
complete process of digestion, but it gets a sensation of its
own by momentary delay in contact with the palate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Effect.</em></div>

<p>Of a still more fragmentary nature is <em>Dramatic Effect</em>&mdash;Effect
strictly so called, and as distinguished from the looser
use of the term for dramatic impressions in general. Such
Effect seems to attach itself to single momentary details,
though in reality these details owe their impressiveness to
their connection with others: the final detail has completed
an electric circle and a shock is given. No element of the
Drama is of so miscellaneous a character and so defies
analysis: all that can be done here is to notice three special
Dramatic Effects.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Irony as an Effect.</em></span><em>Dramatic Irony</em> is a sudden appearance of
double-dealing in surrounding events: a dramatic situation
accidentally starts up and produces a shock by its bearing upon
conflicting states of affairs, both known to the audience, but
one of them hidden from some of the parties to the scene.
This is the special contribution to dramatic effect of Greek
tragedy. The ancient stage was tied down in its subject-matter
to stories perfectly familiar to the audience as sacred
legends, and so almost excluding the effect of surprise: in
Irony it found some compensation. The ancient tragedies
harp upon human blindness to the future, and delight to exhibit
a hero speculating about, or struggling with, or perhaps
in careless talk stumbling upon, the final issue of events
which the audience know so well&mdash;&OElig;dipus, for example,
through great part of a play moving heaven and earth to
pierce the mystery of the judgment that has come upon his
city, while according to the familiar sacred story the offender
can be none other than himself. Shakespeare has used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>almost as great an extent as the Greek dramatists this effect
of Irony. His most characteristic handling of it belongs to
the lighter plays; yet in the group of dramas dealt with in
this work it is prominent amongst his effects. It has been
pointed out how <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Richard III</em> are saturated
with it. There are casual illustrations in <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, as
when the dictator bids his intended murderer</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 123.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Be near me, that I may remember you;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>or in <em>Lear</em>, when Edmund, intriguing guiltily with Goneril, in
a chance expression of tenderness unconsciously paints the
final issue of that intrigue:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii. 25.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Yours in the ranks of death!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A comic variety of Irony occurs in the Trial Scene of <em>The
Merchant of Venice</em>,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 282.</span>when Bassanio and Gratiano in their
distracted grief are willing to sacrifice their new wives if this
could save their friend&mdash;little thinking these wives are so near
to record the vow. The doubleness of Irony is one which
attaches to a situation as a whole:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 60-73.</span>the effect however is
especially keen when a scene is so impregnated with it that
the very language is true in a double sense.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Catesby.</em> 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,</div>
<div class="i4">When men are unprepared and look not for it.</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Hastings.</em> O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out</div>
<div class="i4">With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: <em>and so 'twill do</em></div>
<div class="i4"><em>With some men else, who think themselves as safe</em></div>
<div class="i4"><em>As thou and I.</em></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Nemesis as
an Effect.</em></div>

<p><em>Nemesis</em>, though usually extending to the general movement
of a drama, and so considered below, may sometimes be only
an effect of detail&mdash;a sign connecting very closely retribution
with sin or reaction with triumph.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> iii. 45.</span>Such a Nemesis may be
seen where Cassius in the act of falling on his sword recognises
the weapon as the same with which he stabbed Cæsar.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Dramatic
Foreshadowing.</em></span>Another special variety of effect is <em>Dramatic Foreshadowing</em>&mdash;mysterious
details pointing to an explanation in the
sequel, a realisation in action of the saying that coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>events cast their shadows before them.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 1.</span>The unaccountable
'sadness' of Antonio at the opening of <em>The Merchant of
Venice</em> is a typical illustration.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 68.</span>Others will readily suggest
themselves&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 39.</span>the Prince's shuddering aversion to the Tower
in <em>Richard III</em>, <span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i. 77-90.</span>the letter G that of Edward's heirs the
murderer should be, the crows substituted for Cassius's eagles
on the morning of the final battle. A more elaborate
example is seen in <em>Julius Cæsar</em>,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 18.</span>where the soothsayer's
vague warning 'Beware the Ides of March'&mdash;a solitary voice
that could yet arrest the hero through the shouting of the
crowd&mdash;is later on found, not to have become dissipated,
but to have gathered definiteness as the moment comes
nearer:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 1.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Cæsar.</em> The Ides of March are come.</div>
<div class="i0"><em>Soothsayer.</em> Ay, Cæsar; but not gone.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These three leading Effects may be sufficient to illustrate
a branch of dramatic analysis in which the variety is
endless.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Complexity
applied to
Passion.</em></div>

<p>We are next to consider the application of complexity to
Passion, and the contrasts of passion that so arise. Here
care is necessary to avoid confusion with a complexity of
passion that hardly comes within the sphere of dramatic
criticism. <span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i.</span>In the scene in which Shylock is being teased by
Tubal it is easy to note the conflict between the passions of
greed and paternal affection: such analysis is outside dramatic
criticism and belongs to psychology. In its dramatic
sense Passion applies to experience, not decomposed into its
emotional elements, but grasped as a whole by our emotional
nature: there is still room for complexity of such passion in
the appeal made <em>to different sides of our emotional nature, the
serious and the gay</em>.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Passion-Tone.</em></span>In dealing with this element of dramatic
effect a convenient technical term is <em>Tone</em>. The deep insight
of metaphorical word-coining has given universal sanction to
the expression of emotional differences by analogies of
music: our emotional nature is exalted with mirth and depressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>with sorrow, we speak of a chord of sympathy, a
strain of triumph, a note of despair; we are in a serious
mood, or pitch our appeal in a higher key. These expressions
are clearly musical, and there is probably a half
association of music in many others, such as a theme of
sorrow, acute anguish and profound despair, response of
gratitude, or even the working of our feelings. Most exactly
to the purpose is a phrase of frequent occurrence, the 'gamut
of the passions,' which brings out with emphasis how our
emotional nature in its capacity for different kinds of impressions
suggests a <em>scale</em> of passion-contrasts,
<span class="sidenote"><em>Scale of Passion-Tones.</em></span>not to be
sharply defined but shading off into one another like the
tones of a musical scale&mdash;Tragic, Heroic, Serious, Elevated,
Light, Comic, Farcical. It is with such complexity of tones
that Dramatic Passion is concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mixture of Tones:</em></div>

<p>Now the mere <em>Mixture of Tones</em> is an effect in itself.
For the present I am not referring to the combination of one
tone with another in the same incident (which will be treated
as a distinct variety): I apply it more widely to the inclusion of
different tones in the field of the same play. Such mixture is
best illustrated by music, which gives us an adagio and an
allegro, a fantastic scherzo and a pompous march, within
the same symphony or sonata, though in separate movements.
In <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, as often in plays of
Shakespeare, every tone in the scale is represented.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i.</span>When
Antonio is enduring through the long suspense, and triumphant
malignity is gaining point after point against helpless
friendship, we have travelled far into the Tragic;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 184.</span>the woman-nature
of Portia calling Venetian justice from judicial murder
to the divine prerogative of mercy throws in a touch of the
Heroic; a great part of what centres around Shylock,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> v; <strong>iii.</strong>
i, &amp;c.</span>when
he is crushing the brightness out of Jessica or defying the
Christian world, is pitched in the Serious strain;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i, vii;
<strong>ii.</strong> ix.</span>the incidents
of the unsuccessful suitors, the warm exuberance of Oriental
courtesy and the less grateful loftiness of Spanish family pride,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>might be a model for the Elevated drama of the English
Restoration;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i, &amp;c.</span>the infinite nothings of Gratiano, prince of
diners-out, <span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii.</span>the more piquant small talk of Portia and Nerissa
when they criticise the man-world from the secrecy of a
maiden-bower&mdash;these throw a tone of Lightness over their
sections of the drama; <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii, iii;
<strong>iii.</strong> v, &amp;c.</span>Launcelot is an incarnation of the
conventional Comic serving-man, <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii, from
34.</span>and his Comedy becomes
broad Farce where he teases the sand-blind Gobbo and draws
him on to bless his astonishing beard. <span class="sidenote"><em>a distinction
of the
modern
Drama.</em></span>How distinct an
effect is this mere Mixture of Tones within the same play may
be seen in the fact that the Classical Drama found it impossible.
The exclusive and uncompromising spirit of antiquity
carried caste into art itself, and their Tragedy and
Comedy were kept rigidly separate, and indeed were connected
with different rituals. The spirit of modern life is
marked by its comprehensiveness and reconciliation of
opposites; and nothing is more important in dramatic
history than the way in which Shakespeare and his contemporaries
created a new departure in art, by seizing upon
the rude jumble of sport and earnest which the mob loved,
and converting it into a source of stirring passion-effects.
For a new faculty of mental grasp is generated by this
harmony of tones in the English Drama. If the artist
introduces every tone into the story he thereby gets hold of
every tone in the spectators' emotional nature; the world of
the play is presented from every point of view as it works
upon the various passions, and the difference this makes is
the difference between simply looking down upon a surface
and viewing a solid from all round:&mdash;the mixture of tones, so
to speak, makes passion of three dimensions. Moreover it
brings the world of fiction nearer to the world of nature,
which has never yet evolved an experience in which brightness
was dissevered from gloom: half the pleasure of the
world is wrung out of others' pain; the two jostle in the
street, house together under every roof, share every stage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>of life, and refuse to be sundered even in the mysteries of
death.</p>

<p>Quite a distinct class of effects is produced when the contrasting
tones are not only included in the same drama but
are further brought into immediate contact and made to react
upon each other.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Tone-Play.</em></span><em>Tone-Play</em> is made by simple variety and
alternation of light and serious passions. It has been pointed
out in a previous chapter what a striking example of this is
<em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, in which scene by scene two stories
of youthful love and of deadly feud alternate with one
another as they progress to their climaxes,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 221.</span>until from the
rapture of Portia united to Bassanio we drop to the full
realisation of Antonio in the grasp of Shylock; and again the
cruel anxiety of the trial
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 408.</span>and its breathless shock of deliverance
are balanced by the mad fun of the ring trick
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i.</span>and the joy
of the moonlight scene which Jessica feels is too deep for merriment.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Tone-Relief.</em></span>A slight variation of this is <em>Tone-Relief</em>: in an action
which is cast in a uniform tone the continuity is broken by a
brief spell of a contrary passion, the contrast at once relieving
and intensifying the prevailing tone. One of the best
examples (notwithstanding its coarseness) is the introduction
in <em>Macbeth</em> of the jolly Porter,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 1.</span>who keeps the impatient nobles
outside in the storm till his jest is comfortably finished,
making each furious knock fit in to his elaborate conceit of
Hell-gate. This tone of broad farce, with nothing else like it
in the whole play, comes as a single ray of common daylight
to separate the agony of the dark night's murder from the
agony of the struggle for concealment.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Tone-Clash.</em></span>The mixture of
tones goes a stage further when opposing tones of passion
<em>clash</em> in the same incident and are <em>fused</em> together. These
terms are, I think, scarcely metaphorical: as a physiological
fact we see our physical susceptibility to pleasurable and
painful emotions drawn into conflict with one another in the
phenomena of hysteria; and their mental analogues must be
capable of much closer union. As examples of these effects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>resting upon an appeal to opposite sides of our emotional
nature at the same time may be instanced the flash of comic
irony, <span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 288,
&amp;c.</span>already referred to more than once, that starts up in
the most pathetic moment of Antonio's trial by his friend's
allusion to his newly wedded wife. Of the same double
nature are the strokes of pathetic humour in this play;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 32.</span>as where Antonio describes himself so worn with grief that he
will hardly spare a pound of flesh to his bloody creditor; or
again his pun,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 280.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">For if the Jew do cut but deep enough</div>
<div class="i0">I'll pay it presently with all my heart!</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Shakespeare is very true to nature in thus borrowing the
language of word-play to express suffering so exquisite as to
leave sober language far behind. <span class="sidenote"><em>Tone-Storm.</em></span>Finally Tone-Clash rises
into <em>Tone-Storm</em> in such rare climaxes as the centrepiece of
<em>Lear</em>, in such rare against a tempest of nature as a fitting background
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i-vi.</span>we have the conflict of three madnesses, passion,
idiocy, and folly, bidding against one another, and inflaming
each other's wildness into an inextricable whirl of frenzy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Movement
applied to
Passion.</em></div>

<p>The idea of movement has next to be applied to Passion.
Passion is experience as grasped by our emotional nature:
this will be sensitive not only to isolated fragments of experience,
but equally to the succession of incidents. The
movement of events will produce a corresponding movement
in our emotional nature as this is variously affected by them;
and as the succession of incidents seems to take direction so
the play of our sympathies will seem to take form. Again,
events cannot succeed one another without suggesting causes
at work and controlling forces: when such causes and forces
are of a nature to work upon our sympathy another element
of Passion will appear. <span class="sidenote"><em>Motive
Form and
Motive
Force.</em></span>Under Passion-Movement then are
comprehended two things&mdash;<em>Motive Form</em> and <em>Motive Force</em>.
The first of these is a thing in which two of the great elements
of Drama, Passion, and Plot, overlap, and it will be best considered
<span class="sidenote">page 278.</span>in connection with Plot which takes in dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>form as a whole. Here we have to consider the Motive Forces
of dramatic passion. The dramatist is, as it were, a God in
his universe, and disposes the ultimate issues of human experience
at his pleasure: what then are the principles which
are found to have governed his ordering of events? to
personages in a drama what are the great determinants of
fate?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Poetic Justice
a form
of art-beauty.</em></div>

<p>The first of the great determinants of fate in the Drama is
<em>Poetic Justice</em>. What exactly is the meaning of this term? It
is often understood to mean the correction of justice, as if
justice in poetry were more just than the justice of real life.
But this is not supported by the facts of dramatic story. An
English judge and jury would revolt against measuring out to
Shylock the justice that is meted to him by the court of
Venice, though the same persons beholding the scene in a
theatre might feel their sense of Poetic Justice satisfied;
unless, indeed, which might easily happen, the confusion of
ideas suggested by this term operated to check their acquiescence
in the issue of the play. A better notion of Poetic
Justice is to understand it as the modification of justice by
considerations of art. This holds good even where justice
and retribution do determine the fate of individuals in the
Drama; in these cases our dramatic satisfaction still rests,
not on the high degree of justice exhibited, but on the artistic
mode in which it works. A policeman catching a thief with
his hand in a neighbour's pocket and bringing him to
summary punishment affords an example of complete justice,
yet its very success robs it of all poetic qualities; the same
thief defeating all the natural machinery of the law, yet overtaken
after all by a questionable ruse would be to the poetic
sense far more interesting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Nemesis as
a dramatic
motive.</em></div>

<p>Treating Poetic Justice, then, as the application of art to
morals, its most important phase will be <em>Nemesis</em>, which we
have already seen involves an artistic link between sin and retribution.
The artistic connection may be of the most varied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>description.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Varieties of Nemesis.</em></span>There is a Nemesis of perfect equality, Shylock
reaping measure for measure as he has sown.
When Nemesis
overtook the Roman conspirators it was partly its suddenness
that made it impressive: <span class="sidenote">compare <strong>iii.</strong> i. 118 and 165.</span>within fifty lines of their appeal to
all time they have fallen into an attitude of deprecation. For
Richard, on the contrary, retribution was delayed to the last
moment: to have escaped to the eleventh hour is shown to
be no security.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Jove strikes the Titans down</div>
<div class="i0">Not when they first begin their mountain piling,</div>
<div class="i0">But when another rock would crown their work.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nemesis may be emphasised by repetition and multiplication;
in the world in which Richard is plunged there appears to be
no event which is not a nemesis. Or the point may be the
unlooked-for source from which the nemesis comes; as when
upon the murder of Cæsar a colossus of energy and resource
starts up in the time-serving and frivolous Antony,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 165.</span>whom the
conspirators had spared for his insignificance. Or again,
retribution may be made bitter to the sinner by his tracing
in it his own act and deed: from Lear himself, and from no
other source, Goneril and Regan have received the power
they use to crush his spirit. Nay, the very prize for which
the sinner has sinned turns out in some cases the nemesis
fate has provided for him; as when Goneril and Regan use
their ill-gotten power for the state intrigues which work their
death. And most keenly pointed of all comes the nemesis
that is combined with mockery:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 49.</span>Macbeth, if he had not
essayed the murder of Banquo as an <em>extra</em> precaution, might
have enjoyed his stolen crown in safety;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 219.</span>his expedition
against Macduff's castle slays all <em>except</em> the fate-appointed
avenger; <span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii. 46.</span>Richard disposes of his enemies with flawless
success until <em>the last</em>, Dorset, escapes to his rival.</p>

<p>Such is Nemesis, and such are some of the modes in
which the connection between sin and retribution may be
made artistically impressive. Poetic Justice, however, is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>wider term than Nemesis. The latter implies some offence,
as an occasion for the operation of judicial machinery.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Poetic
Justice
other than
Nemesis.</em></span>But,
apart from sin, fate may be out of accord with character, and
the correction of this ill distribution will satisfy the dramatic
sense. But here again the practice of dramatic providence
appears regulated, not with a view to abstract justice, but to
justice modified by dramatic sympathy: Poetic Justice extends
to the exhibition of fate moving in the interests of those
with whom we sympathise and to the confusion of those
with whom we are in antagonism.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 346-363.</span>Viewed as a piece of
equity the sentence on Shylock&mdash;a plaintiff who has lost his
suit by an accident of statute-law&mdash;seems highly questionable.
On the other hand, this sentence brings a fortune to
a girl who has won our sympathies in spite of her faults;
it makes provision for those for whom there is a dramatic
necessity of providing; above all it is in accord with our
secret liking that good fortune should go with the bright and
happy, and sever itself from the mean and sordid. Whether
this last is justice, I will not discuss: it is enough that it is
one of the instincts of the imagination, and in creative literature
justice must pay tribute to art.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Pathos as a
dramatic
motive.</em></div>

<p>But however widely the term be stretched, justice is only
one of the determinants of fate in the Drama: confusion on
this point has led to many errors of criticism. The case of
Cordelia is in point. Because she is involved in the ruin of
Lear it is felt by some commentators that a consideration of
justice must be sought to explain her death: they find it
perhaps in her original resistance to her father; or the
ingenious suggestion has been made that Cordelia, in her
measures to save her father, invades England, and this breach
of patriotism needs atonement. But this is surely twisting
the story to an explanation, not extracting an explanation
from the details of the story. It would be a violation of all
dramatic proportion, needing the strongest evidence from the
details of the play, if Cordelia's 'most small fault' betrayed

however necessary he finds it to repel the invader, yet
distinctly feels that justice is on the other side. The fact is
that in Cordelia's case, as in countless other cases, motives
determine fate which have in them no relation to justice;
fiction being in this matter in harmony with real life,
where in only a minority of instances can we recognise
any element of justice or injustice as entering into the
fates of individuals. When in real life a little child
dies, what consideration of justice is there that bears
on such an experience? Nevertheless there is an irresistible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>sense of beauty in the idea of the fleeting child-life
arrested while yet in its completeness, before the rude hand
of time has begun to trace lines of passion or hardness; the
parent indeed may not feel this in the case of his own child,
but in art, where there is no mist of individual feeling to
blind, the sense of beauty comes out stronger than the sense
of loss. It is the mission of the Drama thus to interpret the
beauty of fate: it seeks, as Aristotle puts it, to purify our
emotions by healthy exercise. The Drama does with human
experience what Painting does with external nature. There
are landscapes whose beauty is obvious to all; but it is one of
the privileges of the artist to reveal the charm that lies in the
most ordinary scenery, until the ideal can be recognised
everywhere, and nature itself becomes art. Similarly there
are striking points in life, such as the vindication of justice,
which all can catch: but it is for the dramatist, as the artist
in life, to arrange the experience he depicts so as to bring
out the hidden beauties of fate, until the trained eye sees a
meaning in all that happens;&mdash;until indeed the word 'suffering'
itself has only to be translated into its Greek equivalent,
and <em>pathos</em> is recognised as a form of beauty. Accumulation
of Pathos then must be added to Poetic Justice as a determinant
of fate in the Drama. And our sensitiveness to this
form of beauty is nowhere more signally satisfied than when
we see Cordelia dead in the arms of Lear: fate having mysteriously
seconded her self-devotion, and nothing, not even
her life, being left out to make her sacrifice complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Supernatural
as
a dramatic
motive.</em></div>

<p>There remains a third great determinant of fate in the
Drama&mdash;the Supernatural. I have in a former chapter
pointed out how in relation to this topic the modern Drama
stands in a different position from that of ancient Tragedy.
In the Drama of antiquity the leading motive forces were
supernatural, either the secret force of Destiny, or the interposition
of supernatural beings who directly interfered with
human events. We are separated from this view of life by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>revolution of thought which has substituted Providence for
Destiny as the controller of the universe, and absorbed the
supernatural within the domain of Law. <span class="sidenote"><em>The Supernatural
rationalised
in
modern
Drama.</em></span>Yet elements that
had once entered so deeply into the Drama would not be
easily lost to the machinery of Passion-Movement; supernatural
agency has a degree of recognition in modern thought,
and even Destiny may still be utilised if it can be stripped of
antagonism to the idea of a benevolent Providence. To
begin with the latter: the problem for a modern dramatist is
to reconcile Destiny with Law. The characteristics which
made the ancient conception of fate dramatically impressive&mdash;its
irresistibility, its unintelligibility, and its suggestion of
personal hostility&mdash;he may still insinuate into the working of
events: only the destiny must be rationalised, that is, the
course of events must at the same time be explicable by
natural causes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>As an objective
force
in Irony.</em></div>

<p>First: Shakespeare gives us Destiny acting objectively, as
an external force, in the form of <em>Irony</em>, already discussed in
connection with the standard illustration of it in <em>Macbeth</em>.
In the movement of this play Destiny appears in the most
pronounced form of mockery: every difficulty and check
being in the issue converted into an instrument for furthering
the course of events. Yet this mockery is wholly without
any suggestion of malignity in the governing power of the
universe; its effect being rather to measure the irresistibility
of righteous retribution. This Irony makes just the difference
between the ordinary operations of Law or Providence
and the suggestion of Destiny: yet each step in the action is
sufficiently explained by rational considerations.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 37.</span>What more
natural than that Duncan should proclaim his son heir-apparent
to check any hopes that too successful service
might excite?
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iv. 48.</span>Yet what more natural than that this loss of
Macbeth's remote chance of the crown should be the occasion
of his resolve no longer to be content with chances?
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iii. 141.</span>What more natural than that the sons of the murdered king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>should take flight upon the revelation of a treason useless to
its perpetrator as long as they were living? Yet what again
more natural than that the momentary reaction consequent
upon this flight should, <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 21-41.</span>in the general fog of suspicion and
terror, give opportunity to the object of universal dread
himself to take the reins of government? The Irony is
throughout no more than a garb worn by rational history.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>As a subjective
force in Infatuation.</em></div>

<p>Or, again, Destiny may be exhibited as a subjective force
in <em>Infatuation</em>, or <em>Judicial Blindness</em>: 'whom the gods
would destroy they first blind.' This was a conception
specially impressive to ancient ethics; the lesson it gathered
from almost every great fall was that of a spiritual darkening
which hid from the sinner his own danger, obvious to every
other eye, till he had been tempted beyond the possibility of
retreat.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Falling in frenzied guilt, he knows it not;</div>
<div class="i2">So thick the blinding cloud</div>
<div class="i0">That o'er him floats; and Rumour widely spread</div>
<div class="i0">With many a sigh repeats the dreary doom,</div>
<div class="i2">A mist that o'er the house</div>
<div class="i2">In gathering darkness broods.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such Infatuation is very far from being inconsistent with the
idea of Law; indeed, it appears repeatedly in the strong
figures of Scriptural speech, by which the ripening of sin to
its own destruction&mdash;a merciful law of a righteously-ordered
universe&mdash;is suggested as the direct act of Him who is the
founder of the universe and its laws. By such figures God
is represented as hardening Pharaoh's heart; or, again, an
almost technical description of Infatuation is put by the
fervour of prophecy into the mouth of God:</p>

<div class="blockquotesmall">

<p>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut
their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> viii. 13.</div>

<p>In the case of Macbeth the judicial blindness is maintained
to the last moment, and he pauses in the final combat
to taunt Macduff with certain destruction. Yet, while we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>thus get the full dramatic effect of Infatuation, it is so far
rationalised that we are allowed to see the machinery by
which the Infatuation has been brought about:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v. 16.</span>we have heard
the Witches arrange to deceive Macbeth with false oracles.
A very dramatic, but wholly natural, example of Infatuation
appears at the turning-point of Richard's career, where, when
he has just discovered that Richmond is the point from
which the storm of Nemesis threatens to break upon him,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii. 98,
&amp;c.</span>prophecies throng upon his memory which might have
all his life warned him of this issue, had he not been blind
to them till this moment.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 131.</span>Again, Antonio's challenge to
Shylock to do his worst is, as I have already pointed out, an
outburst of <em>hybris</em>, the insolence of Infatuation: but this is
no more than a natural outcome of a conflict between two
implacable temperaments. In Infatuation, then, as in all its
other forms, Destiny is exhibited by Shakespeare as harmonised
with natural law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Supernatural
agencies.</em></div>

<p>Besides Destiny the Shakespearean Drama admits direct
supernatural agencies&mdash;witches, ghosts, apparitions, as well
as portents and violations of natural law. It appears to
me idle to contend that these in Shakespeare are not really
supernatural, but must be interpreted as delusions of their
victims. There may be single cases, such as the appearance
of Banquo to Macbeth, where, as no eye sees it but his own,
the apparition may be resolved into an hallucination. But
to determine Shakespeare's general practice it is enough to
point to the Ghost in <em>Hamlet</em>, which, as seen by three persons
at once and on separate occasions, is indisputably objective:
and a single instance is sufficient to establish the assumption
in the Shakespearean Drama of supernatural beings with a
real existence. Zeal for Shakespeare's rationality is a main
source of the opposite view; but for the assumption of
such supernatural existences the responsibility lies not with
Shakespeare, but with the opinion of the age he is pourtraying.
A more important question is how far Shakespeare uses such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>supernatural agency as a motive force in his plays; how far
does he allow it to enter into the working of events, for the
interpretation of which he is responsible? On this point
Shakespeare's usage is clear and subtle: he uses the agency
of the supernatural to intensify and to illuminate human
action, not to determine it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Intensifying
human
action.</em></div>

<p>Supernatural agency intensifying human action is illustrated
in <em>Macbeth</em>. No one can seriously doubt the objective
existence of the Witches in this play, or that they are endowed
with superhuman sources of knowledge. But the
question is, do they in reality turn Macbeth to crime? In
one of the chapters devoted to this play I have dwelt on the
importance of the point that Macbeth has been already meditating
treason in his heart when he meets the Witches on
the heath. His secret thoughts&mdash;which he betrays in his
guilty start&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 51.</span>have been an invitation to the powers of evil,
and they have obeyed the summons: Macbeth has already
ventured a descent, and they add an impulse downward. To
bring this out the more clearly, Shakespeare keeps Banquo
side by side with Macbeth through the critical stages of the
temptation: Banquo has made no overtures to temptation,
and to him the tempters have no mission. It is noticeable
that where the two warriors meet the Witches on the heath
it is Banquo who begins the conversation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 38-50.</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>
<p>Still he can draw no answer. At last Macbeth chimes in:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Speak, if you can: what are you?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tamperer with temptation has spoken, and in a moment
they break out, 'All hail, Macbeth!' and ply their supernatural
task. <span class="sidenote">57.</span>Later on in the scene, when directly challenged
by Banquo, they do respond and give out an oracle for him.
But into his upright mind the poison-germs of insight into
the future fall harmlessly; it is because Macbeth is already
tainted that these breed in him a fever of crime.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v. and
<strong>iv.</strong> i.</span>In the
second incident of the Witches, so far from their being the
tempters, it is Macbeth who seeks them and forces from
them knowledge of the future. Yet, even here, what is
the actual effect of their revelation upon Macbeth? It is,
like that of his air-drawn dagger, only to marshal him along
the way that he is going.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 74.</span>They bid him beware Macduff:
he answers, 'Thou hast harp'd my fear aright.'
They give him preternatural pledges of safety: are these a
help to him in enjoying the rewards of sin?
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii. 4,
&amp;c.</span>On the contrary,
as a matter of fact we find Macbeth, in panic of suspicion,
seeking security by means of daily butchery; the
oracles have produced in him confidence enough to give
agony to the bitterness of his betrayal, but not such confidence
as to lead him to dispense with a single one of the
natural bulwarks to tyranny. The function of the Witches
throughout the action of this play is exactly expressed by a
phrase Banquo uses in connection with them:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> iii. 124.</span>they are only
'instruments of darkness,' assisting to carry forward courses
of conduct initiated independently of them. Macbeth has
made the destiny which the Witches reveal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Illuminating
human
action.</em></div>

<p>Again, supernatural agency is used to illuminate human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>action: the course of events in a drama not ceasing to obey
natural causes, but becoming, by the addition of the supernatural
agency, endowed with a new art-beauty. <span class="sidenote"><em>The Oracular
Action.</em></span>The great
example of this is the <em>Oracular Action</em>. This important
element of dramatic effect&mdash;how it consists in the working
out of Destiny from mystery to clearness, and the different
forms it assumes&mdash;has been discussed at length in a former
chapter. The question here is, how far do we find such
superhuman knowledge used as a force in the movement of
events? As Shakespeare handles oracular machinery, the
conditions of natural working in the course of events are
not in the least degree altered by the revelation of the
future. The actor's belief (or disbelief) in the oracle may be
one of the circumstances which have influenced his action&mdash;as
it would have done in the real life of the age&mdash;but to the
spectator, to whom the Drama is to reveal the real governing
forces of the world, the oracular action is presented not
as a force but as a light. It gives to a course of events the
illumination that can be in actual fact given to it by History,
the office of which is to make each detail of a story interesting
in the light of the explanation that comes when all the
details are complete. Only it uses the supernatural agency to
project this illumination into the midst of the events themselves,
which History cannot give till they are concluded;
and also it carries the art-effect of such illumination a stage
further than History could carry it, by making it progressive
in intelligibility, and making this progress keep pace with the
progress of the events themselves. Fate will allow none but
Macduff to be the slayer of Macbeth. True: but Macduff
(who moreover knows nothing of his destiny) is the most
deeply injured of Macbeth's subjects, and as a fact we find
it needs the news of his injury to rouse him to his task;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> iii.</span>as he approaches the battle he feels that the ghosts of his wife
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> vii. 15.</span>and children will haunt him if he allows any other to be the
tyrant's executioner. Thus far the interpretation of History
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>might go: but the oracular machinery introduced points
dimly to Macduff before the first breath of the King's suspicion
has assailed him, and the suggestiveness becomes
clearer and clearer as the convergence of events carries the
action to its climax. The natural working of human events
has been undisturbed: only the spectator's mind has been
endowed with a special illumination for receiving them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Supernatural
as
Dramatic
Background.</em></div>

<p>In another and very different way we have supernatural
agency called in to throw a peculiar illumination over
human events. In dealing with the movement of <em>Julius
Cæsar</em> I have described at length the <em>Supernatural Background</em>
of storm, tempest, and portent, which assist the emotional
agitation throughout the second stage of the action.
These are clearly supernatural in that they are made to suggest
a mystic sympathy with, and indeed prescience of, mutations
in human life. Yet their function is simply that of
illumination: they cast a glow of emotion over the spectator
as he watches the train of events, though all the while the
action of these events remains within the sphere of natural
causes. In narrative and lyric poetry this endowment of
nature with human sympathies becomes the commonest of
poetic devices, personification; and here it never suggests
anything supernatural because it is so clearly recognised as
belonging to expression. But 'expression' in the Drama
extends beyond language, and takes in presentation; and it
is only a device in presentation that tumult in nature and
tumult in history, each perfectly natural by itself, are made
to have a suggestion of the supernatural by their coincidence
in time. After all there is no real meaning in storm
any more than in calm weather, only that contemplative
observers have transferred their own emotions to particular
phases of nature: it would seem, then, a very slight and
natural reversal of the process to call in this humanised
nature to assist the emotions which have created it.</p>

<p>In these various forms Shakespeare introduces supernatural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>agency into his dramas. In my discussion of them
it will be understood that I am not in the least endeavouring
to explain away the reality of their supernatural character.
My purpose is to show for how small a proportion of his
total effect Shakespeare draws on the supernatural, allowing it
to carry further or to illustrate, but not to mould or determine
a course of events. It will readily be granted that he brings
effect enough out of a supernatural incident to justify the use
of it to our rational sense of economy.</p>

have increased the obscurity by taking 'enormous' in its rare sense of
'irregular,' 'out of order,' and making it refer to the state of England.
Surely it is used in its ordinary meaning, and applies to France; the

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Interest of Plot.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Idea of
Plot as the
application
of design to
human life.</em></div>

<p class="dropcap">WE now come to the third great division of Dramatic
Criticism&mdash;Plot, or the purely intellectual side of
action. Action itself has been treated above as the mutual
connection and interweaving of all the details in a work of
art so as to unite in an impression of unity. But we have
found it impossible to discuss Character and Passion entirely
apart from such action and interworking: the details
of human interest become dramatic by being permeated with
action-force. When however this mutual relation of all the
parts is looked at by itself, as an abstract interest of design,
the human life being no more than the material to which
this design is applied, then we get the interest of Plot. So
defined, I hope Plot is sufficiently removed from the vulgar
conception of it as sensational mystery, which has done so
much to lower this element of dramatic effect in the eyes of
literary students. If Plot be understood as the extension of
design to the sphere of human life, threads of experience
being woven into a symmetrical pattern as truly as vari-coloured
threads of wool are woven into a piece of wool-work,
then the conception of it will come out in its true
dignity. What else is such reduction to order than the
meeting-point of science and art? Science is engaged in
tracing rhythmic movements in the beautiful confusion of
the heavenly bodies, or reducing the bewildering variety of
external nature to regular species and nice gradations of life.
Similarly, art continues the work of creation in calling ideal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>order out of the chaos of things as they are. And so the
tangle of life, with its jumble of conflicting aspirations, its
crossing and twisting of contrary motives, its struggle and
partnership of the whole human race, in which no two individuals
are perfectly alike and no one is wholly independent
of the rest&mdash;this has gradually in the course of ages been
laboriously traced by the scientific historian into some such
harmonious plan as evolution. But he finds himself long
ago anticipated by the dramatic artist, who has touched
crime and seen it link itself with nemesis, who has transformed
passion into pathos, who has received the shapeless
facts of reality and returned them as an ordered economy of
design. This application of form to human life is Plot:
and Shakespeare has had no higher task to accomplish than
in his revolutionising our ideas of Plot, until the old critical
conceptions of it completely broke down when applied to
his dramas. The appreciation of Shakespeare will not be
complete until he is seen to be as subtle a weaver of plots as
he is a deep reader of the human heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Unity applied
to
Plot.</em></div>

<p>We have to consider Plot in its three aspects of unity,
complexity, and development. <span class="sidenote"><em>The Single
Action.</em></span>The simplest element of
Plot is the <em>Single Action</em>, which may be defined as any train
of incidents in a drama which can be conceived as a separate
whole. Thus a series of details bringing out the idea of a
crime and its nemesis will constitute a Nemesis Action, an
oracle and its fulfilment will make up an Oracular Action, a
problem and its solution a Problem Action. Throughout
the treatment of Plot the root idea of <em>pattern</em> should be
steadily kept in mind: in the case of these Single Actions&mdash;the
units of Plot&mdash;we have as it were the lines of a geometrical
design, made up of their details as a geometrical
line is made up of separate points. <span class="sidenote"><em>Forms of
Dramatic
Action.</em></span>The <em>Form</em> of a dramatic
action&mdash;the shape of the line, so to speak&mdash;will be that
which gives the train of incidents its distinctiveness: the
nemesis, the oracle, the problem. An action may get its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>distinctiveness from its tone as a Comic Action or a Tragic
Action; or it may be a Character Action, when a series of
details acquire a unity in bringing out the character of
Hastings or Lady Macbeth; an action may be an Intrigue,
or the Rise and Fall of a person, or simply a Story like the
Caskets Story. Finally, an action may combine several
different forms at the same time, just as a geometrical line
may be at once, say, an arch and a spiral. The action that
traces Macbeth's career has been treated as exhibiting a
triple form of Nemesis, Irony, and Oracular Action; further,
it is a Tragic Action in tone, it is a Character Action in its
contrast with the career of Lady Macbeth, and it stands in
the relation of Main Action to others in the play.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Complexity
applied to
Action: a
distinction
of Modern
Drama.</em></div>

<p>Now what I have called Single Action constituted the
whole conception of Plot in ancient Tragedy; in the
Shakespearean Drama it exists only as a unit of Complex
Action. The application of complexity to action is rendered
particularly easy by the idea of pattern, patterns which
appeal to the eye being more often made up of several lines
crossing and interweaving than of single lines. Ancient
tragedy clung to 'unity of action,' and excluded such matter
as threatened to set up a second interest in a play. Modern
Plot has a unity of a much more elaborate order, perhaps
best expressed by the word <em>harmony</em>&mdash;a harmony of distinct
actions, each of which has its separate unity. The illustration
of harmony is suggestive. Just as in musical harmony
each part is a melody of itself, though one of them
leads and is <em>the</em> melody, so a modern plot draws together
into a common system a Main Action and other inferior yet
distinct actions. Moreover the step from melody alone to
melody harmonised, or that from the single instruments of
the ancient world to the combinations of a modern orchestra,
marks just the difference between ancient and modern art
which we find reflected in the different conception of Plot
held by Sophocles and by Shakespeare. Shakespeare's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>plots are federations of plots: in his ordering of dramatic
events we trace a common self-government made out of
elements which have an independence of their own, and at
the same time merge a part of their independence in common
action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Analysis of
Action.</em></div>

<p>The foundation of critical treatment in the matter of Plot
is the <em>Analysis</em> of Complex Action into its constituent Single<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Actions. This is easy in such a play as <em>The Merchant of
Venice</em>. Here two of the actions are stories, a form of
unity readily grasped, and which in the present case had an
independent existence outside the play. These identified and
separated, it is easy also to see that Jessica constitutes a
fresh centre of interest around which other details gather
themselves; that the incidents in which Launcelot and
Gobbo are concerned are separable from these; while the
matter of the rings constitutes a distinct episode of the
Caskets Story: already the junction of so many separate
stories in a common working gratifies our sense of design.
In other plays where the elements are not stories the individuality
of the Single Actions will not always be so positive:
all would readily distinguish the Lear Main plot from
the Underplot of Gloucester, but in the subdivision of these
difference of opinion arises. <span class="sidenote"><em>Canons of
Analysis.</em></span>In an Appendix to this
chapter I have suggested schemes of Analysis for each of
the five plays treated in this work: <span class="sidenote"><em>Analysis
tentative not positive.</em></span>I may here add four
remarks. (1) Any series of details which can be collected
from various parts of a drama to make up a common interest
may be recognised in Analysis as a separate action.
It follows from this that there may be very different modes
of dividing and arranging the elements of the same plot:
such Analysis is not a matter in which we are to look for
right or wrong, but simply for better or worse. No scheme
will ever exhaust the wealth of design which reveals itself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>a play of Shakespeare; and the value of Analysis as a critical
process is not confined to the scheme it produces, but includes
also the insight which the mere effort to analyse a drama
gives into the harmony and connection of its parts. <span class="sidenote"><em>Design as
the test of
Analysis.</em></span>(2) The
essence of Plot being design, that will be the best scheme of
Analysis which best brings out the idea of symmetry and
design. <span class="sidenote"><em>Analysis
exhaustive.</em></span>(3) Analysis must be exhaustive: every detail in
the drama must find a place in some one of the actions.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The elementary
actions not
mutually
exclusive.</em></span>(4) The constituent actions will of course not be mutually
exclusive, many details being common to several actions:
these details are so many meeting-points, in which the lines
of action cross one another.&mdash;With these sufficiently obvious
principles I must leave the schemes of analysis in the
Appendix to justify themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Enveloping
Action.</em></div>

<p>In the process of analysis we are led to notice special
forms of action: in particular, the <em>Enveloping Action</em>. This
interesting element of Plot may be described as the fringe,
or border, or frame, of a dramatic pattern. It appears when
the personages and incidents which make up the essential
interest of a play are more or less loosely involved with
some interest more wide-reaching than their own, though
more vaguely presented. It is seen in its simplest form
where a story occupied with private personages connects
itself at points with public history: homely life being thus
wrapped round with life of the great world; fiction having
reality given to it by its being set in a frame of accepted
fact. We are familiar enough with it in prose fiction.
Almost all the Waverley Novels have Enveloping Actions,
Scott's regular plan being to entangle the fortunes of individuals,
which are to be the main interest of the story, with
public events which make known history. Thus in <em>Woodstock</em>
a Cavalier maiden and her Puritan lover become, as
the story proceeds, mixed up in incidents of the Commonwealth
and Restoration; or again, the plot of <em>Redgauntlet</em>,
which consists in the separate adventures of a pair of Scotch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>friends, is brought to an issue in a Jacobite rising in which
both become involved. The Enveloping Action is a favourite
element in Shakespeare's plots. In the former part of
the book I have pointed out how the War of the Roses
forms an Enveloping Action to <em>Richard III</em>; how its connection
with the other actions is close enough for it to catch
the common feature of Nemesis; and how it is marked
with special clearness by the introduction of Queen Margaret
and the Duchess of York to bring out its opposite sides.
In <em>Macbeth</em> there is an Enveloping Action of the supernatural
centring round the Witches: the human workings
of the play are wrapped in a deeper working out of destiny,
with prophetic beings to keep it before us. <em>Julius Cæsar</em>,
as a story of political conspiracy and political reaction, is
furnished with a loose Enveloping Action in the passions of
the Roman mob: this is a vague power outside recognised
political forces, appearing at the beginning to mark that uncertainty
in public life which can drive even good men to conspiracy,
while from the turning-point it furnishes the force
the explosion of which is made to secure the conspirators'
downfall. A typical example is to be found in <em>Lear</em>, all the
more typical from the fact that it is by no means a prominent
interest in the play. The Enveloping Action in this
drama is the French War. The seeds of this war are sown
in the opening incident,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 265.</span>in which the French King receives
his wife from Lear with scarcely veiled insult:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> ii. 23.</span>it troubles
Gloucester in the next scene that France is 'in choler parted.'
Then we get, in the second Act, a distant hint of rupture
from the letter of Cordelia read by Kent in the stocks.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> ii. 172.</span>In the other scenes of this Act the only political question is of
'likely wars toward' between the English dukes;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 11.</span>but at the
beginning of the third Act Kent directly connects these
quarrels of the dukes with the growing chance of a war with
France:
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 19-34.</span>the French have had intelligence of the 'scattered
kingdom,' and have been 'wise in our negligence.' In this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>Act Gloucester confides to Edmund the feeler he has received
from France,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii.</span>and his trustfulness is the cause of his
downfall;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 22.</span>Edmund treacherously reveals the confidence to
Cornwall,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v. 18.</span>and makes it the occasion of his rise. Gloucester's
measures for the safety of Lear have naturally a connection
with the expected invasion,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> vi. 95-108.</span>and he sends him to Dover to
find welcome and protection.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> vii. 2,
&amp;c.</span>The final scene of this Act,
devoted to the cruel outrage on Gloucester, shows from its
very commencement the important connection of the Enveloping
Action with the rest of the play: the French army
has landed, and it is this which is felt to make Lear's escape
so important, and which causes such signal revenge to be
taken on Gloucester. Throughout the fourth Act all the
threads of interest are becoming connected with the invading
army at Dover; if this Act has a separate interest of its own
in Edmund's intrigues with both Goneril and Regan at once,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii. 11,
15; <strong>iv.</strong> v.
12, 30 &amp;c.</span>yet these intrigues are possible only because Edmund is
hurrying backwards and forwards between the princesses in
the measures of military preparation for the battle. The
fifth Act has its scene on the battlefield, and the double
issue of the battle stamps itself on the whole issue of the
play: the death of Lear and Cordelia is the result of the
French defeat, while, on the other hand,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> iii. 238,
256.</span>all who were to
reap the fruits of guilt die in the hour of victory. Thus
this French War is a model of Enveloping Action&mdash;outside
the main issues, yet loosely connecting itself with every
phase of the movement; originating in the incident which is
the origin of the whole action; the possibility of it developed
by the progress of the Main story, alike by the cruelty
shown to Lear and by the rivalry between his daughters;
the fear of it playing a main part in the tragic side of the
Underplot, and the preparation for it serving as occasion
for the remaining interest of intrigue; finally, breaking out
as a reality in which the whole action of the play merges.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Economy:
supplementary
to
Analysis.</em></div>

<p>From Analysis we pass naturally to <em>Economy</em>. Considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>in the abstract, as a phase of plot-beauty, Economy may be
defined as that perfection of design which lies midway between
incompleteness and waste. Its formula is that a play
must be seen to contain all the details necessary to the
unity, no detail superfluous to the unity, and each detail
expanded in exact proportion to its bearing on the unity.
In practice, as a branch of treatment in Shakespeare-Criticism,
Economy, like Analysis, deals with complexity of
plot. The two are supplementary to one another. The one
resolves a complexity into its elements, the other traces the
unity running through these elements. Analysis distinguishes
the separate actions which make up a plot, while Economy
notes the various bonds between these actions and the way
in which they are brought into a common system: it being
clear that the more the separateness of the different interests
can be reduced the richer will be the economy of design.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Economic
Forms.</em></div>

<p>It will be enough to note three Economic Forms.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Connection</em></span>The
first is simple <em>Connection</em>: the actual contact of action
with action, the separate lines of the pattern meeting at
various points. In other words, the different actions have
details or personages in common. Bassanio is clearly a
bond between the two main stories of <em>The Merchant of
Venice</em>, in both of which he figures so prominently; and it has
been pointed out that the scene of Bassanio's successful choice
is an incident with which all the stories which enter into the
action of the play connect themselves.
<span class="sidenote"><em>and Linking.</em></span>There are <em>Link
Personages,</em> who have a special function so to connect
stories, and similarly <em>Link Actions</em>: Gloucester in the play
of <em>Lear</em> and the Jessica Story in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> are
examples. Or Connection may come by the interweaving
of stories as they progress: they alternate, or fill, so to
speak, each other's interstices. <span class="sidenote">from <strong>ii.</strong> i. to
<strong>iii.</strong> ii. 319.</span>Where the Story of the
Jew halts for a period of three months, the elopement of
Jessica comes to occupy the interval; or again, scenes
from the tragedy of the Gloucester family separate scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>from the tragedy of Lear, until the two tragedies have
become mutually entangled. Envelopment too serves as a
kind of Connection: the actions which make up such a play
as <em>Richard III</em> gain additional compactness by their being
merged in a common Enveloping Action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Dependence.</em></div>

<p>Another Form of Economy is <em>Dependence</em>. This term expresses
the relation between an underplot and main plot,
or between subactions and the actions to which they are
subordinate. <span class="sidenote">compare
<strong>i.</strong> i. 35, 191.</span>The fact that Gloucester is a follower of
Lear&mdash;he would appear to have been his court chamberlain&mdash;makes
the story of the Gloucester family seem to spring
out of the story of the Lear family; that we are not called
upon to initiate a fresh train of interest ministers to our
sense of Economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Symmetry.</em></div>

<p>But in the Shakespearean Drama the most important
Economic Form is <em>Symmetry</em>: between different parts of a
design symmetry is the closest of bonds.
<span class="sidenote"><em>Balance.</em></span>A simple form of
Symmetry is the <em>Balance</em> of actions, by which, as it were,
the mass of one story is made to counterpoise that of another.
If the Caskets Story, moving so simply to its goal
of success, seems over-weighted by the thrilling incidents of
the Jew Story, we find that the former has by way of compensation
the Episode of the Rings rising out of its close,
while the elopement of Jessica and her reception at Belmont
transfers a whole batch of interests from the Jew side
of the play to the Christian side. Or again, in a play such
as <em>Macbeth</em>, which traces the Rise and Fall of a personage,
the Rise is accompanied by the separate interest of Banquo
till he falls a victim to its success; to balance this we have
in the Fall Macduff, who becomes important only after
Banquo's death, and from that point occupies more and
more of the field of view until he brings the action to a
close. Similarly in <em>Julius Cæsar</em> the victim himself dominates
the first half; Antony, his avenger, succeeds to his
position for the second half. <span class="sidenote"><em>Parallelism
and
Contrast.</em></span>More important than Balance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>as forms of Symmetry are <em>Parallelism</em> and <em>Contrast</em> of
actions. Both are, to a certain extent, exemplified in the
plot of <em>Macbeth</em>: the triple form of Nemesis, Irony, and Oracular
binding together all the elements of the plot down to
the Enveloping Action illustrates Parallelism, and Contrast
has been shown to be a bond between the interest of Lady
Macbeth and of her husband. But Parallelism and Contrast
are united in their most typical forms in <em>Lear</em>, which is at
once the most intricate and the most symmetrical of Shakespearean
dramas. A glance at the scheme of this plot shows
its deep-seated parallelism. A Main story in the family of
Lear has an Underplot in the family of Gloucester. The
Main plot is a problem and its solution, the Underplot is an
intrigue and its nemesis. Each is a system of four actions:
there is the action initiating the problem with the three
tragedies which make up its solution, there is again the
action generating the intrigue and the three tragedies
which constitute its nemesis. The threefold tragedy in
the Main plot has its elements exactly analogous, each to
each, to the threefold tragedy of the Underplot: Lear and
Gloucester alike reap a double nemesis of evil from the
children they have favoured, and good from the children they
have wronged; the innocent Cordelia has to suffer like the
innocent Edgar; alike in both stories the gains of the
wicked are found to be the means of their destruction. Even
in the subactions, which have only a temporary distinctness
in carrying out such elaborate interworking, the same
Parallelism manifests itself. <span class="sidenote">e.g. <strong>i.</strong> iv.
85-104;
<strong>ii.</strong> ii, &amp;c.</span>They run in pairs: where Kent
has an individual mission as an agency for good, Oswald
runs a course parallel with him as an agency for evil;
<span class="sidenote">e.g. <strong>iv.</strong> ii.
29;
<strong>v.</strong> iii, from
59.</span>of the
two heirs of Lear, Albany, after passively representing the
good side of the Main plot, has the function of presiding
over the nemesis which comes on the evil agents of the
Underplot, while Cornwall, who is active in the evil of the
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> vii.</span>Main plot, is the agent in bringing suffering on the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>victims of the Underplot;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii; <strong>iv.</strong>
v; <strong>v.</strong> iii.
238.</span>once more from opposite sides
of the Lear story Goneril and Regan work in parallel intrigues
to their destruction. Every line of the pattern runs
parallel to some distant line. Further, so fundamental is the
symmetry that we have only to shift the point of view and
the Parallelism becomes Contrast. If the family histories
be arranged around Cordelia and Edmund, as centres of
good and evil in their different spheres, we perceive a sharp
antithesis between the two stories extending to every detail:
though stated already in the chapter on <em>Lear</em>, I should like
to state it again in parallel columns to do it full justice.</p>

<table summary="parallelism">
<tr><td>In the <span class="smcap">Main Plot</span> a Daughter,</td>

<td>In the <span class="smcap">Underplot</span> a Son,</td></tr>

<tr><td>Who has received nothing but Harm from her father,</td>
<td>Who has received nothing but Good from his father,</td></tr>
<tr><td>Who has had her position unjustly torn
from her and given to her undeserving
elder Sisters,</td>

<td>Who has, contrary to justice, been advanced to the position of an innocent elder Brother he had maligned,
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Nevertheless  sacrifices
herself to save the
Father who <em>did</em> the
injury from the Sisters
who <em>profited</em> by it.</td>

<td>Nevertheless is seeking the destruction of the
Father who <em>did</em> him the unjust kindness, when he falls by the hand of the Brother
who <em>was wronged</em> by it.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The play of <em>Lear</em> is itself sufficient to suggest to the critic
that in the analysis of Shakespeare's plots he may safely expect
to find symmetry in proportion to their intricacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Movement
applied to
Plot: Motive
Form.</em>

</div>

<p>Movement applied to Plot becomes <em>Motive Form</em>: without
its being necessary to take the play to pieces Motive Form is
the impression of design left by the succession of incidents
in the order in which they actually stand. <span class="sidenote"><em>Simple
Movement:
the Line of Motion a
straight
line.</em></span>The succession
of incidents may suggest progress to a goal, as in the
Caskets Story. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>This is preeminently Simple<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Movement:
the Line of Motion becomes a straight line. We get the
next step by the variation that is made when a curved line is
substituted for a straight line: in other words, when the
succession of incidents reaches its goal, but only after a
diversion. <span class="sidenote"><em>Complicated
Movement:
the
Line of
Motion a
curve.</em></span>This is what is known as <em>Complication and Resolution</em>.
A train of events is obstructed and diverted from
what appears its natural course, which gives the interest
of Complication: after a time the obstruction is removed
and the natural course is restored, which is the Resolution
of the action: the Complication, like a musical discord,
having existed only for the sake of being resolved. No
clearer example could be desired than that of Antonio,
whose career when we are introduced to it appears to be
that of leading the money-market of Venice and extending
patronage and protection all around; by the entanglement
of the bond this career is checked and Antonio turned into
a prisoner and bankrupt; then Portia cuts the knot and
Antonio becomes all he has been before.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii. 173.</span>Or again, the
affianced intercourse of Portia and Bassanio begins with an
exchange of rings;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii.</span>by the cross circumstances connected with
Antonio's trial one of them parts with this token, and the result
is a comic interruption to the smoothness of lovers' life,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>v.</strong> i. 266.</span>until
by Portia's confession of the ruse the old footing is restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Action-Movement
distinguished
from Passion-Movement.</em></div>

<p>Such Complicated Movement belongs entirely to the
Action side of dramatic effect. It rests upon design and
the interworking of details; its interest lies in obstacles interposed
to be removed, doing for the sake of undoing, entanglement
for its own sake; in its total effect it ministers to
a sense of intellectual satisfaction, like that belonging to a
musical fugue, in which every opening suggested has been
sufficiently followed up. We get a movement of quite a
different kind when the sense of design is inseparable from
effects of passion, and the movement is, as it were, traced in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>our emotional nature. In this case a growing strain is put
upon our sympathy which is not unlike Complication. But
no Resolution follows: the rise is made to end in fall, the
progress leads to ruin; in place of the satisfaction that
comes from restoring and unloosing is substituted a fresh
appeal to our emotional nature, and from agitation we pass
only to the calmer emotions of pity and awe. There is
thus a <em>Passion-Movement</em> distinct from <em>Action-Movement</em>;
and, analogous to the Complication and Resolution of the
latter, Passion-Movement has its <em>Strain and Reaction</em>.
<span class="sidenote"><em>The Line
of Passion
a Regular
Arch,</em></span>The
Line of Passion has its various forms. A chapter has been
devoted to illustrating one form of Passion-Movement, which
may be called the <em>Regular Arch</em>&mdash;if we may found a technical
term on the happy illustration of Gervinus. The
example was taken from the play of <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, the
emotional effect in which was shown to pass from calm
interest to greater and greater degree of agitation, until after
culminating in the centre it softens down and yields to the
different calmness of pity and acquiescence.
<span class="sidenote"><em>an Inclined
Plane</em></span>The movement
of <em>Richard III</em> and many other dramas more resembles
the form of an <em>Inclined Plane</em>,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii. 46.</span>the turn in the emotion
occurring long past the centre of the play.
<span class="sidenote"><em>or a Wave
Line.</em></span>Or again,
there is the <em>Wave Line</em> of emotional distribution, made by
repeated alternations of strain and relief. This is a form
of Passion-Movement that nearly approaches Action-Movement,
and readily goes with it in the same play; in <em>The Merchant
of Venice</em> the union of the two stories gives such alternate
Strain and Relief, and the Episode of the Rings comes
as final Relief to the final Strain of the trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>For 'Comedy,' 'Tragedy,' substitute, in the case of Shakespeare,</em></div>

<p>The distinction between Action-Movement and Passion-Movement
is of special importance in Shakespeare-Criticism,
inasmuch as it is the real basis of distinction between
the two main classes of Shakespearean dramas. Every one
feels that the terms Comedy and Tragedy are inadequate,
and indeed absurd, when applied to Shakespeare. The distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>these terms express is one of Tone, and they were
quite in place in the ancient Drama, in which the comic
and tragic tones were kept rigidly distinct and were not
allowed to mingle in the same play. Applied to a branch of
Drama of which the leading characteristic is the complete
Mixture of Tones the terms necessarily break down, and the
so-called 'Comedies' of <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> and <em>Measure
for Measure</em> contain some of the most tragic effects in
Shakespeare. The true distinction between the two kinds
of plays is one of Movement, not Tone. In <em>The Merchant
of Venice</em> the leading interest is in the complication of Antonio's
fortunes and its resolution by the device of Portia.
In all such cases, however perplexing the entanglement of
the complication may have become, the ultimate effect of
the whole lies in the resolution of this complication; and
this is an intellectual effect of satisfaction. In the plays
called Tragedies there is no such return from distraction to
recovery: our sympathy having been worked up to the emotion
of agitation is relieved only by the emotion of pathos or
despair. Thus in these two kinds of dramas the impression
which to the spectator overpowers all other impressions, and
gives individuality to the particular play, is this sense of intellectual
or of emotional unity in the movement:&mdash;is, in other
words, Action-Movement or Passion-Movement. <span class="sidenote"><em>'Action-Drama,'
'Passion-Drama.'</em></span>The two
may be united, as remarked above in the case of <em>The Merchant
of Venice</em>; but one or the other will be predominant
and will give to the play its unity of impression. The distinction,
then, which the terms Comedy and Tragedy fail
to mark would be accurately brought out by substituting for
them the terms Action-Drama and Passion-Drama.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Compound
Movement.</em></div>

<p>With complexity of action comes complexity of movement.
<em>Compound Movement</em> takes in the idea of the relative motion
amongst the different actions into which a plot can be
analysed. A play of Shakespeare presents a system of wheels
within wheels, like a solar system in motion as a whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>while the separate members of it have their own orbits to
follow. <span class="sidenote"><em>Its three
Modes of
Motion:
Similar
Motion,</em></span>The nature of Compound Movement can be most
simply brought out by describing its three leading Modes of
Motion. In <em>Similar Motion</em> the actions of a system are
moving in the same form. The plot of <em>Richard III</em>, for
example, is a general rise and fall of Nemesis made up of
elements which are themselves rising and falling Nemeses.
Such Similar Motion is only Parallelism looked at from the
side of movement. A variation of it occurs when the form
of one action is distributed amongst the rest: the main
action of <em>Julius Cæsar</em> is a Nemesis Action, the two subactions
are the separate interests of Cæsar and Antony,
which put together amount to Nemesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Contrary
Motion,</em></div>

<p>In <em>Contrary Motion</em> the separate actions as they move on
interfere with one another, that is, each acts as complicating
force to the other, turning it out of its course; in reality
they are helping one another's advance, seeing that complication
is a step in dramatic progress. <em>The Merchant of
Venice</em> furnishes an example. The Caskets Story progresses
without check to its climax; in starting it complicates the
Jew action&mdash;for before Bassanio can get to Belmont he
borrows of Antonio the loan which is to entangle him in the
meshes of the Jew's revenge; then the Caskets Story as a
result of its climax resolves this complication in the Story of
the Jew&mdash;for the union of Portia with Bassanio provides the
deliverer for Bassanio's friend. But in thus resolving the
Story of the Jew the Caskets Story, in the new phase of it
that has commenced with the exchange of betrothal rings,
itself suffers complication&mdash;the circumstances of the trial
offering the suggestion to Portia to make the demand for
Bassanio's ring. Thus of the two actions moving on side
by side the one interferes with and diverts the other from its
course, and again in restoring it gets itself diverted. This
mutual interference makes up Contrary Motion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Convergent
Motion.</em></div>

<p>A third mode of Compound movement is <em>Convergent Motion</em>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>by which actions, or systems of actions, at first separate,
become drawn together as they move on, and assist one
another's progress. Once more the play of <em>Lear</em> furnishes
a typical example. This play, it will be recollected, includes
two distinct systems of actions tracing the story of two
separate families. Moreover the main story after its opening
incident presents, so far as movement is concerned, three
different sides, according as its incidents centre around Lear,
Goneril, or Regan. The first link between these diverse
actions is Gloucester, the central personage of the whole
plot.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> i. 35, 191.</span>Gloucester has been the King's chamberlain and his
close friend,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 93.</span>the King having been godfather to his son.
Accordingly, in the highly unstable political condition of a
kingdom divided equally between two unprincipled sisters,
Gloucester represents a third party, the party of Lear: he
holds the balance of power, and the effort to secure him
draws the separate interests together.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>i.</strong> v. 1.</span>Thus as soon as
Lear and Goneril have quarrelled Lear sends Kent to Gloucester,
and our actions begin to approach one another.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 9.</span>Before this messenger can arrive we hear of 'hints and ear-kissing
arguments' as to rupture between the dukes, and
we see Regan and her husband making a hasty journey&mdash;'out
of season threading dark-eyed night'&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 121.</span>in order to be
the first at Gloucester's castle;
<span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> iv. 192.</span>when Goneril in self-defence
follows, all the separate elements of the main plot have
found a meeting-point. But this castle of Gloucester in
which they meet is the seat of the underplot, and the two
systems become united in the closest manner by this central
linking. <span class="sidenote"><strong>ii.</strong> i. 88-131,
esp.
112.</span>Regan arrives in time to use her authority in furthering
the intrigue against Edgar as a means of recommending
herself to the deceived Gloucester; the other intrigue
of the underplot,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> v, &amp;c.</span>that against Gloucester himself, is
promoted by the same means when Edmund has betrayed
to Regan his father's protection of Lear; while the meeting
of both sisters with Edmund lays the foundation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>mutual intriguing which forms the further interest of the
entanglement between underplot and main story. All the
separate lines of action have thus moved to a common centre,
and their concentration in a common focus gives opportunity
for the climax of passion which forms the centrepiece
of the play. Then the Enveloping Action comes in
as a further binding force, and it has been pointed out above
how throughout the fourth and fifth Acts all the separate
actions, whatever their immediate purpose, have an ultimate
reference to Dover as the landing-place of the invading army:
in military phrase Dover is the common <em>objective</em> on which
all the separate trains of interest are concentrating. In this
way have the actions of this intricate plot, so numerous and
so separate at first, been found to converge to a common
centre and then move together to a common <em>dénouement</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Turning-points.</em></div>

<p>The distinction of movement from the other elements of
Plot leads also to the question of <em>Turning-points</em>, an idea
equally connected with movement and with design. In the
movement of every play a Turning-point is implied: movement
could not have dramatic interest unless there were a
change in the direction of events, and such change implies a
point at which the change becomes apparent. Changes of
a kind may be frequent through the progress of a play, but
one notable point will stand out at which the ultimate issues
present themselves as decided, the line of motion changing
from complication to resolution, the line of passion from
strain to reaction. <span class="sidenote"><em>The Catastrophe:
or
Focus of
Movement.</em></span>Such a point is technically a <em>Catastrophe</em>:
a word whose etymological meaning suggests a turning
round so as to come down. <span class="sidenote"><em>The Centre
of Plot.</em></span>In Shakespeare's dramatic
practice we find a not less important Turning-point in relation
to the design of the plot. This is always at the exact
centre&mdash;the middle of the middle Act&mdash;and serves as a
balancing-point about which the plot may be seen to be
symmetrical: it is a <em>Centre of Plot</em> as the Catastrophe is
a Focus of Movement. The Catastrophe of <em>The Merchant of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>Venice</em> is clearly Portia's judgment in the Trial Scene, by
which in a moment the whole entanglement is resolved.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> i. 305.</span>In an earlier chapter it has been pointed out how the union of
Portia and Bassanio&mdash;<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> ii.</span>at the exact centre of the play&mdash;is the
real determinant of the whole plot, uniting the complicating
and resolving forces, and constituting a scene in which all
the four stories find a meeting-point. In <em>Richard III</em>,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iv.</strong> ii. 45.</span>while
the Catastrophe comes in the hero's late recognition of his
own nemesis, yet there has been, before this and in the
exact centre, a turn in the Enveloping Action,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iii. 15.</span>which includes
all the rest, shown by the recognition that Margaret's
curses have now begun to be fulfilled. The exact centre of
<em>Macbeth</em>, as pointed out above,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 20.</span>marks the hero's passage
from rise to fall, that is from unbroken success to unbroken
failure: the corresponding Catastrophe in this play is double,
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 49;
<strong>v.</strong> viii. 13.</span>a first appearance of Nemesis in Banquo's ghost, its final
stroke in the revelation of Macduff's secret of birth.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> i. 122.</span><em>Julius
Cæsar</em> presents the interesting feature of the Catastrophe
and Central Turning-point exactly coinciding, in the triumphant
appeal of the conspirators to future history. <em>Lear</em>,
according to the scheme of analysis suggested in this work,
has its Catastrophe at the close of the initial scene, by
which time the problem in experience has been set up in
action, and the tragedies arising out of it thenceforward
work on without break to its solution.
<span class="sidenote"><strong>iii.</strong> iv. 45.</span>A Centre of Plot is
found for this play where, in the middle Scene of the middle
Act, the third of the three forms of madness is brought into
contact with the other two and makes the climax of passion
complete. This regular union by Shakespeare of a marked
catastrophe, appealing to every spectator, with a subtle
dividing-point, interesting to the intellectual sense of analysis,
illustrates the combination of force with symmetry,
which is the genius of the Shakespearean Drama: it throughout
presents a body of warm human interest governed by a
mind of intricate design.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Conclusion.</em></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>

The plan laid down for this work has now been followed
to its completion. The object I have had in view throughout
has been the <em>recognition</em> of inductive treatment in literary
study. For this purpose it was first necessary to distinguish
the inductive method from other modes of treatment founded
on arbitrary canons of taste and comparisons of merit, so
natural in view of the popularity of the subject-matter, and
to which the history of Literary Criticism has given an unfortunate
impetus. This having been done in the Introduction,
the body of the work has been occupied in applying
the inductive treatment to some of the masterpieces of
Shakespeare. The practical effect of such exposition has
been, it may be hoped, to intensify the reader's appreciation
of the poet, and also to suggest that the detailed and methodical
analysis which in literary study is usually reserved
for points of language is no less applicable to a writer's
subject-matter and art. But to entitle Dramatic Criticism to
a place in the circle of the inductive sciences it has further
appeared necessary to lay down a scheme for the study as a
whole, that should be scientific both in the relation of its
parts to one another, and in the attainment of a completeness
proportioned to the area to which the enquiry was
limited and the degree of development to which literary
method has at present attained. The proper method for
the nascent science was fixed as the enumeration and arrangement
of topics; and by analogy with the other arts
a simple scheme for Dramatic Criticism was found, in which
all the results of the analysis performed in the first part of
the book could be readily distributed under one or other of
the main topics&mdash;Character, Passion, and Plot. Incidentally
the discussion of Shakespeare has again and again reminded
us of just that greatness in the modern Drama which judicial
criticism with its inflexibility of standard so persistently
missed. Everywhere early criticism recognised our poet's
grasp of human nature, yet its almost universal verdict of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>him was that he was both irregular in his art as a whole,
and in particular careless in the construction of his plots.
We have seen, on the contrary, that Shakespeare has
elevated the whole conception of Plot, from that of a mere
unity of action obtained by reduction of the amount of
matter presented, to that of a harmony of design binding
together concurrent actions from which no degree of complexity
was excluded. And, finally, instead of his being a
despiser of law, we have had suggested to us how Shakespeare
and his brother artists of the Renaissance form a
point of departure in legitimate Drama, so important as amply
to justify the instinct of history which named that age the
Second Birth of literature.</p>
